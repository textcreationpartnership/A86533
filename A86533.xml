                  <note>The author's preface is followed by an Epistle to the reader, subscribed by Edward Hopkins and William Goodwin, Hartford, 28 Oct., 1647; a poem "In obitum viri doctissimi Thom√¶ Hookeri," by Samuel Stone; two shorter poems by John Cotton and E. Rogers; and a further commendation to the reader by Thomas Goodwin, April 17, 1648.</note>
                  <note>To some copies of the work John Cotton's "The way of Congregational churches cleared" was appended. Mr. Cotton's treatise continues the answers to Rutherford, begun by Mr. Hooker in pt. 1, chap. 10, which ends on p. 139; the next page is blank, and chapter 11 follows, numbered 185 with a new signature. It is thought that it may have been the intention of the editors to incorporate Mr. Cotton's work in this division of the Survey, between p. 139 and 185.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Only as in other births, so here, the barrennesse and fruitfullnesse of severall ages, depend meerly upon Gods good pleasure; who opens and shuts the womb of truth from bearing, as he sees fit, according to the counsell of his own will.</p>
            <p>Not that there is any change in the truth, but the alteration grows, according to mens apprehensions, to whom it is more or lesse discovered, according to Gods most just judgement, and their own deservings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometimes</hi> God makes an eclipse of the truth at midday, that so he might expresse his <hi>wrath from Heaven,</hi> against the unthankfulnesse, prophanesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> and Atheisme of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant world.</p>

            <p>Some denied the Diety of our Saviour, and would have him meer man. As <hi>Ebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

            <p>Thus while the Pope pretended to be the <hi>Vicar</hi> and <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent</hi> of Christ, to supply his absence here on earth, by being <hi>caput ministeriale,:</hi> in issue he justled him out of the room and right of his <hi>HEADSHIP.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They then began</hi> to sigh for some deliverance from this <hi>spirituall,</hi> more then <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage; and being thus prepared to lend a listening ear unto the truth, God sent them
<pb facs="tcp:111062:4"/> some little reviving in their extremities, a day-star arising in this their darknesse.</p>
            <p>He stirred up the spirit of the <hi>Waldenses, Armachanus, Wickliff, Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerom of Prage,</hi> who openly proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the usurpations of that man of sin, stoutly asserted the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sufficiency of the Scriptures, cleared and maintained the deciding authority thereof in all the waies and worship of God, and so set up the Lord Iesus, as the only <hi>PROPHET</hi> of his Church.</p>
            <p>After them succeeded <hi>Luther,</hi> who made a spoil of the Popes treasury, marred wholly his market, and the sale of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, and so wonderfully cooled and quenched the fire of Purgatory, and the Popes kitchin: that his holinesse, and the wretched rabble of all his black-guard, were forced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all their power and policy to crush the credit of that champion, and the authority of that doctrine which he taught, but all in vain.</p>
            <p>For the vertue of the <hi>bloudy sacrifice of Christonce offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> for all, the perfect satisfaction, Iustification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, came so strongly to be received and maintained in many places and persons of note. That now all tho unbloudy sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, masses, and multitudes of that trash, which the merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers did studiously set forth to sale, and by which they set up themselves in the hearts of the people, grew to be abhorred of such as were pious and conscientious, and all such who would but suffer themselves to be led by the principles of right reason. And thus the <hi>PRIESTLY</hi> office of our Saviour came in some measure to be acknowledged, and appropriated to him, whose peculiar it was.</p>
            <p>Only the <hi>SUPREMACY OF THAT KINGLY POWER,</hi> upon which the Pope had encroached, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the possession thereof so long, was yet retained and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified (as reason would) with greatest resolution, nor could he suffer the appearance of any approach or battery to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:111062:5"/> that might seem to hazard the safty of that, but he sets him fully and fiercely against <hi>Reformation,</hi> which sticks like the cunny-skinat the hcad principally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence</hi> for the surprisall of so strong a peice, the Lord in his providence provided many means to make approaches thereunto by little and little. The <hi>Councells of Constance and Basill</hi> just led the Pope to the Wall, and took the wall of him, made him lower then the councell, but let him enjoy his Headship over all his Officers and particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Henry the eighth,</hi> he further clipped his wings in temporalls, shook off and renounced <hi>that supremacy</hi> that he had arrogated and erected over kings and kingdomes in former ages: Only that is storied of him as his mistake, he <hi>cut off the head of Popery, but left the body of it</hi> (in <hi>Arch-Bishops, Primates, Metropolitans, Archdeacons,</hi>) yet within his realm, and the Churches there established.</p>
            <p>This power having a <hi>double</hi> respect: Partly to <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> Partly to <hi>Churches:</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of these was abated, when a <hi>Parity in the Ministery</hi> came to be acknowledged and received in the Churches of the reformation. And that the sole and princely power, which was arrogated and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Bishops</hi> and their Officers, over the faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of Christ, was cashiered, as contrary to the government and power bequeathed to each particular Officer of his own appointment, who all have <hi>Ministerium, non Dominium,</hi> are <hi>stewards,</hi> not <hi>Lords of Gods inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether <hi>all Ecclesiasticall power</hi> be impaled, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated and rightly <hi>taken in to the Presbytery</hi> alone: Or that <hi>the people of the particular Churches should come in for a share, according to their places and proportions;</hi> This <hi>is lest as the subject of the inquiry of this age,</hi> and that which occasions <hi>great thoughts of heart</hi> of all hands: Great thoughts of heart in <hi>the Presbytery,</hi> as being very
<pb facs="tcp:111062:5"/> loth to part with that so chief priviledge, and of which they have taken possession so many years. Great thoughts of heart <hi>amongst the Churches,</hi> how they may clear their right, and claim it in such pious sobriety and moderation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Saints: being unwilling to loose their cause and comfort, meerly upon a <hi>nihil dicit:</hi> or for ever to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of so precious a legacy, as they conceive this is, though it hath been withheld from them, by the tyranny of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and prescription of times. Nor can they conceive it lesse, then a heedlesse betraying of their speciall liberties, and not selling but casting away their inheritance, and right, by a carelesse silence, when the course of providence, as the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of things now present themselves, allows them a writt <hi>Ad melius inquirendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it seemes God sets out <hi>this disquisition</hi> (fall the issue on which side it will) as most <hi>sutable and seasonable to these times,</hi> which appear fruitfull in discoveries: Truth seeming to be in travell, having fulfilled her appointed moneths, and the instant opportunity of her deliverance draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on apace, as the Scripture account, may seem to give symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes to that purpose, and such as will not fail.</p>
            <p>For <hi>these</hi> are the <hi>times</hi> drawing on, wherein <hi>Prophecies</hi> are to attain their <hi>performances:</hi> and its a received rule, and I suppose most safe, <hi>when Prophecies are fulfilled they are best interpreted,</hi> the accomplishment of them is the best Commentary.</p>

And for these pains of his, I suppose the Churches will (I must professe for mine own particular I do) owe him much.

            <p>The first of these, to wit; The <hi>spirituall Kingdome of Christ,</hi> is most opposed by a generation of <hi>Enthusiasts;</hi> and <hi>Familists,</hi> who having refined the loathsome follies of their former predecessours, do adventure to set open their conceits, with greater insolency, to the view of the world; and under the pretence of free-grace, they destroy the grace of God in the power and operations of it, in the hearts and lives of men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other,</hi> which concerns the managing <hi>of the outward kingdome,</hi> unlesse my prospective much deceives me, is coming towards its last triall: because there is more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now given to each, to plead their own interests, when in former times the <hi>tyranny of Antichrist,</hi> and blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto his dictates, turned the tomb-stone of untimely silence upon all mens endeavours, buried all mens debates in their own bosomes, or else the <hi>unreasonable rigour of</hi> the <hi>prelates</hi> laboured to destroy the being of the defense as soon as it came to the birth.</p>
            <p>This present term of Gods patience promiseth some allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his people, the distressed and despised ones of Christ, <hi>sub form√¢ pauperis,</hi> to take leave, to lay claim to these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,

But when men set up their sheaves (though it be but <hi>in a dream,</hi> as <hi>Josephs</hi> was) and fall out with every one, that will not fall down and adore them, they will bring much trouble into the world, but little advantage to the truth, or peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The Reader must know for his direction in this inquiry, my <hi>aim only</hi> was, and is, to lay down, and that briefly, the <hi>grounds of our practice,</hi> according to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of light I have received, and to give answer to such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which might seem to weaken the evidence thereof: <hi>declining purposely, for the present, the examination of such answers, which are made to the arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by some of our Reverend Brethren, touching the same subject:</hi> because I would neither prejudice nor prevent their proper defense, which I do suppose in the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test season, they will so present unto the world, as shall be fully satisfactory to such, as love and desire the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>The Summe is, we <hi>doubt not what we practise,</hi> but its beyond all doubt, that <hi>all men are liars,</hi> and we are in the number of those poor f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore the errand upon which this present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is sent, is summarily to shew these two things unto the world,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. That there must be more said</hi> (then yet it hath been my happinesse to see) before the principles we professe will be shaken, and consequently it cannot be expected, that we should be unsetled in our practice.</p>

            <p>Its the perfection of a man, amidst these many weaknesses, we are surrounded withall, by many changes to come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Its the honour and conquest of a man truly wise to be conquered by the truth: and he hath attained the greatest liberty, that suffers himself to be led captive thereby.</p>
            <p>That the discourse comes forth in such a homely dresse and course habit, the Reader must be desired to consider, It comes <hi>out of the wildernesse,</hi> where curiosity is not studied. Planters if they can provide cloth to go warm, they leave the cutts and lace to those that study to go fine.</p>
            <p>As it is beyond my skill, so I professe it is beyond my care to please the nicenesse of mens palates, with any auaintnesse of language. They who covet more sauce then meat, they must provide cooks to their minde. It was a cavill cast upon <hi>Hierom,</hi> that in his writings he was <hi>Ciceronianus non Christianus:</hi>

               </gap>, as the Apostle hath it, if I would, I could not lavish out in the loosenesse of language, and as the case stands, if I could answer any mans desire in that daintinesse of speech, I would not do the matter that Injury which is now under my hand: <hi>Ornari res ipsa negat.</hi> The substance and solidity of the frame is that, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

            <p>If the manner of the discourse should oecasion any disrellish in the apprehension of the weaker Reader, because it may seem too <hi>Logicall, or Scholasticall,</hi> in regard of the <hi>terms</hi> I use, or the way of dispute that I proceed in, in some places: I have these two things to professe,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That plainesse and perspicuity, both for matter and manner of expression, are the things, that I have conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously indeavoured in the whole debate: for I have ever thought writings that come abroad, they are not to dazle, but direct the apprehension of the meanest, and I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it the chiefest part of Iudicious learning, to make a hard point easy and familiar in explication. <hi>Qui non vult intelligi, debet negligi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. The nature of the subject</hi> that is under my hand, is such, that I was constrained to accommodate and conform my expressions more or lesse, in some kinde of sutablenesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: for in some passages of the dispute, the particulars in their very rise and foundation, border so neer upon the <hi>principles of Logick:</hi> (as whether <hi>Ecclesia Catholica visibilis,</hi> was to be attended, as a <hi>Totum universale,</hi> or <hi>Integrale</hi>) that either I must resolve to say nothing, or to speak (though as sparingly as I could of such things) <hi>as the quality of the things</hi> did require. And let any man make a triall, and I do much mistake my self, but he will be nceessitated to take the same course, if he speaks to the cause. If the Reader <hi>shall demand how far this way of Church-proceeding receives approbation by any common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence amongst us:</hi> I shall plainly and punctually expresse my self in a word of truth, in these following points, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Visible Saints are the only true and meet matter, whereof a visible Church should be gathered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederation is the form.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>There is no Presbyteriall Church</hi> (i. e. <hi>A Church made up of the Elders of many Congregations appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Classickwise, to rule all those Congregations) in the N. T.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Church Congregationall is the first subject of the keys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Each Congregation compleatly constituted of all Officers, hath sufficient power in her self, to exercise the power of the keyes, and all Church discipline, in all the censures thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordination is not before election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There ought to be no ordination of a Minister at large,</hi> Namely, such as should make him Pastour without a People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The election of the people hath an instrumentall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall vertue under Christ, to give an outward call unto an Officer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordination is only a solemn installing of an Officer into the Office, unto which he was formerly called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Children of such, who are members of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ought only to be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The consent of the people gives a causall vertue to the compleating of the sentence of excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilst the Church remains a true Church of Christ, it doth not loose this power, nor can it lawfully be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consociation of Churches should be used, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such consociations and Synods have allowance to counsell and admonish other Churches, as the case may require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if they grow obstinate in errour or sinfull mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, they should renounce the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with them.</hi>

               <hi>Nor do their constitutions binde formalit√®r &amp; juridic√®.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all these I have leave to professe the joint judgement of all the Elders upon the river: Of <hi>New-haven, Guilford, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield:</hi> and of most <hi>of the Elders of the Churches in the Bay,</hi> to whom I did send in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and did receive approbation from them, under their hands: Of the rest (to whom I could not send) I cannot so affirm; but this I can say, That <hi>at a common meeting,</hi> I was desired by them all, to publish what now I do.</p>
            <p>Lastly, To ease the ordinary Reader, who happily is not acquainted with discourses of this kinde, I shall take leave to lend him this little advise.</p>
            <p>The Treatise being divided into <hi>four parts,</hi> if he will be intreated to survey the Table set before the work, by a short and sudden cast of his eye, he shall presently perceive those particulars, which as so many pillars principall, bear up the whole frame.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1.</hi> Look at the Church <hi>in its first rise and essence,</hi> The causes of it, in the efficient, Matter and Form: The Qualification of it, in its precedency, power, priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, make up the first part.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Look at the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>compleated with all her Officers,</hi> the number and nature of them, in her elestions, and Ordinations, where the loathsome title of Independency is opened: these lay out the matter of the second part.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3.</hi> The Church thus constituted, <hi>The power that she exerciseth in admissions, dispensations of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and censures,</hi> especially that grand and great censure of excommunication, how it is to be managed, and the power of it lastly resolved. In these the third part is spent.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>4.</hi> The consociation of Churches in Classes, Synods, and councels, is shortly discussed in the fourth part.</item>

            <p>Let him be intreated to carry these along in his considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will readily know, whether to refer any thing, and where to finde any thing; and as readily conceive the method and manner, both of the constitution of the Church, as the House of God, and the right managing of all the occasions and affairs thereof.</p>
            <p>In the handling of all these particulars, so full of difficulty and obscurity, I am not such a stranger at home, but that I am easily sensible of the weight of the matter and mine own weaknesse: and therefore I can professe in a word of truth, that against mine own inclination and affection, I was haled by importunity to this so hard a task, to kindle my rush candle, to joyn with the light of others, at least to occasion them to set up their lamps.</p>
            <p>Now he <hi>that is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> pave out all the waies of his people, and make their paths plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: <hi>Lead us all into that truth,</hi> which will lead us unto eternall life: bring us once unto that impotency and impossibility, <hi>that we can do nothing against the truth, but for it,</hi> that so our Congregations, may not only be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> temple, but be really what was prophesied the Churches should be, in these last daies, <hi>Jehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah.</hi> In the Armes of his everlasting mercy I leave thee, but never cease to wish,</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He eternall blessed Lord, whose waies of mercy to his redeemed ones (as his judgements to others) are unsearchable and past finding out, hath through the contrivances of his infinite wisdom, reserved many glorious discoveries of the for ever to be adored depths and riches of his grace in Jesus Christ, to this last age of the world. And as he hath fitted instruments for the holding forth of the mystery of Christ (the hope of glory) in that great plot and work of redemption, and application with much evidence and power to the gaining of many souls to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: So he hath in a speciall manner caused the truths concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his visible government of the Saints in this world, in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowship with himself, and one with another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of the Gospel, as with more glory to break forth, so with more power to lay hold upon the spirits of many, then in former times: So that not contenting themselves with mixt fellowships, and other pollutions in the things of Christ (the abhorred errors and mistakes of their former waies) and not finding incouragement for what they desired according to God, in the places of their then sojourning: They were provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to make many inquiries on earth, and send up many cries to him, whom their souls loved in heaven, to know where he fed his flock at noon.</p>
            <p>The favour and faithfullnesse of the Lord Jesus (the King and head of his Church) was not wanting to his people in this thing. He answered the desires of many in carrying them into this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, where they acknowledge themselves to have received
<pb facs="tcp:111062:12"/> warmth and refreshing under his wings, he sent out his light and his truth, and led them to his holy mountain, and his tabernacles.</p>
            <p>Among others (dear Brethren) we have been sharers in this rich priviledge, a large portion hath been carved out unto us, by the hand of our blessed God in the things of his kingdom, and grace: we have for many years lived under his shadow, been fed with the dainties of his house, injoied the full improvement of the large abilities of faithfull watchmen and overseers for our good, to whom our comforts and welfare in every kinde have been pretious.</p>
            <p>But the only wise and holy God, for our great unworthinesse hath lately made a sad breath upon us by the death of our most dear Pastor (the Author of the ensuing Treatise) whereby our glory is much eclipsed, our comforts not a little impaired, and our fears justly multiplied. The stroke is direfull and amasing, when such a stake is taken out of the hedge, such a pillar from the house, such a Pastor from his flook, in such a time and place as this.</p>
            <p>It is not our purpose or is it sutable to our condition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to lay out the breadth of the excellencies wherewith through the abundant grace of the Lord he was inriched and fitted for the service of his great name, or if we were willing to improve our selves in that kinde, have our pens received an anointing for such an imploiment; what, we expresse is onely to put you and our selves in minde of the unvaluable losse we have sustained, that our hearts being deeply and duly affected under that sad afflicting providence, we may look up to the holy one of Israel our Redeemer, who teacheth to profit, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction may be sealed up unto us thereby.</p>
            <p>He was (as you well know) one of a thousand, whose dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and unweariednesse (besides his other endowments) in the work committed to him, was almost beyond compare. He revealed the whole counsell of the Lord unto us, kept nothing back, dividing the word aright. His care was of strong and weak, sheep and lambs, to give a portion to each in due season, delighting in holy administrations, which by him were held forth in much beauty and glory. In this work his Master found him, and so cal'd him to enter into his glory. Some of you are not ignorant with what strength of importunity he was drawn to this <hi>present service,</hi> and with what fear and care he attended it.
<pb facs="tcp:111062:12"/> The weight and difficultie of the work was duly apprehended by him, and he lookt upon it, as somewhat unsutable to a Pastor, whose head and heart and hands, were full of the imploiments of his proper place.</p>
            <p>Besides, his spirit mostly delighted in the search of the mystery of Christ, in the unsearchable riches thereof, and the work and method of the spirit, in the communication of the same unto the soul for its everlasting welfare, some discovery whereof may hereafter be presented to the world, as the Lord gives liberty and opportunity.</p>
            <p>Such strength of parts clothed with humility, such clear and high apprehensions of the things of God, with a ready cheerfull condescending to the infirmities of the weak (which was his daily study and practice) are not often to be found among the sons of men, nor yet the sons of God in this world.</p>
            <p>The present discourse was finished by himself in the time of his life, and sent neer two years since to be made publique, but the Lord in whose hands all our works and waies are, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined otherwise. That sad providence was entertained by him in reference to the present work, with much contentednesse and humble submission to the good pleasure of the most high, and if he might have injoyed the liberty of his own judgement and desires, no further discoveries should have been made to the world of these his labours, they should have been buried in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting silence; but at last he was overborn and condescended to what now is again endeavoured, though before the full transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, he was translated from us to be ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Reader may well conceive, had the judicious Author li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to peruse the Copy now sent, the work would have been more compleat, and perhaps some additions made in some parts thereof. But we have not yet had the happinesse to finde among his papers what was intended in that kinde.</p>
            <p>We have little more to say at present, but to let the Reader know, that nothing is added to, or taken from the Authors pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Copy for the substance of it; and to assure him that his unwillingnesse to make his thoughts publique, did not arise from any doubts in him concerning the truth of what is held forth in the present disputes, for he was abundantly satisfied therein: <hi>As he beleeved so he spake,</hi> but other considerations retarded his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to that work.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111062:13"/>
            <p>It hath been rightly observed that disputations in Religion, though they are sometimes necessary, yet they are usually dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by drawing commonly the best spirits into the head from the heart, and, if extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re be not taken, abating pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections towards God, and love towards men. But you (Brethren) who knew him, are witnesses of the prevailing live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of the rich grace of God, in the heart and life of this Author in all respects, even unto his very end, the Lord who taught him from his youth, and enabled him then to declare and hold forth his wondrous works, forsook him not when he was gray-headed, but he went on in the strength of the Lord God, making <hi>mention of his righteousnesse, even of his only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were some workings in his thoughts before the sending away of the first Copy, to have recommended these his labours in an Epistle to this Church, and thereby left them (to use his own expressions) as his last legacy to us: Though these thoughts of his were not then prosecuted, yet there being necessary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion upon this great turn of providence to intimate a few words unto the Reader at this time, we thought it not amisse to acquaint you, our beloved Brethren, with those former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of our most dear Pastor, whose remembrance we hope will be for ever pretious with you all, that you may look upon this work (the result of many thoughts and praiers) as the <hi>last breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of his love towards you, for your establishment in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent truths. It shall be our endeavour that in due season you may have other of his labours among you, in your daily view for your further comfort and edification, and so may still hear him speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you in this way, whose lively voice you can hear no more. And we shall not cease to look up to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and God of all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for you, and for our selves, that we may be duly sensible of the price that was in our hands, effectually humbled under any misimprovements, and conscientiously prosecute the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges yet continued, least a worse thing happen to us, our candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick be removed, and we left wholly desolate, in this time of the Lords riding circuit over all his Churches, and that hour of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation which is even now over the face of the whole earth.</p>

               <l>He stored up rich treasures from his youth.</l>
               <l>While he was in the ∆≤niversity,</l>
               <l>His light did shine, his parts were very high.</l>
               <l>When he was fellow of <hi>Emmanuell,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Much learning in his solid head did dwell.</l>
               <l>His knowledge in Theologie Divine,</l>
               <l>In <hi>Chelmesford</hi> Lectures divers years did shine.</l>
               <l>Dark Scriptures he most clearly did expound,</l>
               <l>And that great mystery of Christ profound.</l>
               <l>He had a singular clear insight, in</l>
               <l>The souls conversion unto God from sin:</l>
               <l>And in what method men come to inherit,</l>
               <l>Both Christ and all his fullnesse by the Spirit.</l>
               <l>He made the truth appear by light of reason,</l>
               <l>And spake most comfortable words in season.</l>
               <l>To poor distressed sinners and contrite,</l>
               <l>And such as to the Promises had right.</l>
               <l>Which did revive their hearts and make them wonder:</l>
               <l>And in reproof he was a sonne of Thunder.</l>
               <l>He spake the Word with such authority,</l>
               <l>That many from themselves to Christ did fly,</l>
               <l>His preaching was full of the holy Ghost,</l>
               <l>Whose presence in him we admired most.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:111062:14"/>
               <l>He did excell in Mercy, Peace and Love,</l>
               <l>Was Lion-like in courage, yet a Dove.</l>
               <l>He from the largenesse of his royall heart,</l>
               <l>His treasures was most ready to impart.</l>
               <l>To many Ministers he was a father;</l>
               <l>Who from his light, much pleasant light did gather.</l>
               <l>The principles he held were clear and strong:</l>
               <l>He was to truth a mighty pillar long.</l>
               <l>I can affirm I know no man more free</l>
               <l>From Errors in his judgement, then was he.</l>
               <l>His holy heart delighted much to act</l>
               <l>The will of God, wherein he was exact.</l>
               <l>No other way could with his spirit suit;</l>
               <l>His conversation was full of fruit.</l>
               <l>He was abundant in the work of God</l>
               <l>∆≤ntill death came, and heaven was his abod.</l>
               <l>At his last clause Christ found him doing well,</l>
               <l>His blamelesse life, but few can parallel.</l>
               <l>The peace he had full thirty yeares agoe</l>
               <l>At death was firm, not touched by the foe.</l>
               <l>Of all his daies and times, the last were best:</l>
               <l>The end of such is peace, he is at rest.</l>
               <l>His lipps, they were a spring and tree of life,</l>
               <l>∆≤nto his people, family and wife,</l>
               <l>In which much wisdome, health and grace was found,</l>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Times</hi> (sayth <hi>David) are in thy Hand:</hi> Neither <hi>is it</hi> meete, <hi>for us</hi> so much as, <hi>to know the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which the Father hath put in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> This is as conspicuously made good in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the <hi>seasons</hi> for <hi>justifying his own cause,</hi> as of any other event whatsoever. Wherein, as he hath as great an interest; so, <hi>himselfe</hi> being the principall, yea, sole <hi>AUTHOR</hi> of all that is written or spoken for it, assumes the prerogative to judge and determine of the fittest opportunity, <hi>for every word,</hi> that shall be uttered, much more publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in testimony thereof. This I have with silence and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on learned (as many other lessons) from his so strong and all wise-disposing Providence towards this treatise; And some other, both passages and treatises that have related to, or been intended for defence and cleering of this Argument.</p>
            <p>This Treatise was finisht and sent over transcribed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eye and exact review of the eminently accomplisht Author himselfe, well nigh Two yeeres since; who also then followed it (as I have heard) with many prayers and teares, for a blessing upon the publishing. But it was then buried in the rude waves of the vast Ocean, with many precious Saints, in their passage hither. The most of those that were affected to this cause, did then judge, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Opportunity, and importunity of that season, (that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuously called for a <hi>Modell</hi> of this way) this to be a losse not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensable, at any other time. But God (we see, and that by this strange disaster) thought best to reserve it rather, for <hi>such a time as this:</hi> as wherein, the noyse and tumultuous outcries of many, being somewhat stilled, <hi>the words of the wise,</hi> may bee (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes) the better <hi>heard in quiet.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 9.17.</note> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging violence of that hot season, (which like a <hi>fiery Oven,</hi> (as the Prophet speakes) devoured all that was cast into it) being a little moderated, and allayed, men may be better disposed to heare and consider <hi>Reason,</hi> especially coming from <hi>this hand,</hi> whom all men <hi>knew,</hi> and <hi>had in esteeme,</hi> as a <hi>man of God,</hi> of more then
<pb facs="tcp:111062:16"/> an ordinary spirit. And perhaps <hi>some</hi> of those <hi>Reasonings,</hi> which were then, or would still have been deemed as broken and <hi>bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That forementioned destiny, that hath attended this booke, hath, at times visited my thoughts with an apprehension of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Like Omen to the cause</hi> it selfe it pleads for <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Presbyteriall Government:</hi> That after an overwhelming of it with a <hi>flood</hi> of obloquies and disadvantages and mis-representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and injurious oppressions, <hi>cast out after it,</hi> it might (in <hi>the time</hi> which God alone hath <hi>put in his own power</hi>) be again emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; yea and shoot forth out of the same seeds of Truth, which have been scattered and buried under ground. Which hath the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entertainment with mee, because from our first entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this conflict, I made account and lookt for it, That this truth and all that should be said for it, was ordained as Christ (of whom every truth is a Ray and beame) to be as <hi>a seede of corne, which unlesse it fall to the ground and dye, and this perhaps together with some of the persons that professe it, it brings not forth much fruit.</hi> All that is His, is alwayes at first <hi>sown in weaknesse;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>riseth in power:</hi> One Age <hi>sowes</hi> and <hi>another reapes:</hi> And yet in these latter dayes wherein the light and Sunshine growes hotter and more intense, the same age may perhaps see, and enjoy both the seed-time, and the encrease.</p>
            <p>However, certaine <hi>I</hi> am of this, which may more visibly be read out of this, and a more then usuall conjunction of many other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences falling out at this juncture of time, evidently proclaiming by a lowd and powerfull voyce of providence, that Gods designe and pleasure is (for what ends and issues himselfe onely knowes) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and hold up this controversie amongst us, as if it were but new begun, notwithstanding all that sluggish backwardnesse in those that have been called, yea cryed out upon, to maintain it; and those slight and despising thoughts in others, as not worth the pains and travaile. God not onely having stirred up the spirit of this great <hi>worthy</hi> to undertake the defence thereof (whose humility and modesty to appeare in Print in any other subject, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abilities in all kinds, both for preaching and disputing

            <p>Yea, and which is more eminently observable to this purpose in hand, that <hi>the Assembly of Divines</hi> it selfe (Providence so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring and contriving it) should <hi>now, and not till now</hi> (though upon the Order of the Honourable House long since issued forth, a faint attempt towards an entrance thereunto was made by them) should now be set aworke and betake themselves a new, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and convincingly make forth the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> both in the generall principles, upon which it is to be made forth, and the particularities thereof: And so not only take a new survey, but go over, upon a new woof, the whole peece and platform they had debated &amp; before presented, but under <hi>A THERE MAY BE,</hi> and <hi>IT IS LAWFUL AND AGREEABLE TO THE WORD,</hi> and the like: <hi>THE LORD,</hi> by all these coincident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents calling his Saints to a fresh and more serious revisall of these Controversies, as not yet determined, nor fully cleared either to the satisfaction of God or man.

            <p>As touching <hi>this Treatise,</hi> and the worthy <hi>Author</hi> of it, I intend not to preface any thing by commendation of either unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which were indeed, to lay paint upon burnished marble, or add light unto the Sun.

                  <hi>CHAP. I. Ecclesiasticall Policy Defined.</hi> Ecclesiasticall Policy is a skill of ordering the affairs of Christs house, according to the pattern of his word.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Kill.]</hi> When we speak of spirituall things, we desire to speak in the words which the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the holy Ghost teacheth, and so we shall compare spirituall words and spirituall things together. And therefore it is, though the Government, whereof we are now to intreat, shareth, with other of the like rank, in the generall nature common to them and it, and thence may (as it is) truely be called, an Art or Policy, as civil governments are stiled: and there be a like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and proportion of reason, in regard of the nature of the work: yet we attend the language of the Apostle, who, when he would instruct <hi>Timothy,</hi> touching the subject now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111062:20"/> of, and furnish him with directions fitting and sufficient thereunto, he terms it, <hi>by knowledge or skill, how to demean himself in the house of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Its the knowledge of the duty of some rule that lieth upon him.</hi> Thus knowledge how to converse and carry our selves in Church-work, as the effect, leads us by the hand to look to the cause, whence it comes, namely the rule by the staple-precepts whereof, as by the Kings standard, this knowledge hath its being, and is bounded in its operations, the effect thus is expressed, but the cause is implied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordering.]</hi> Its the art of ordering the affairs of the Church, For so the Apostle speaks, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.5. <hi>When I behold your faith and order,</hi> as if he would referre the whole work of the Gospel to these two heads, <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline.</hi> So much of Religion, as concernes the nature and work of Faith inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the soul towards God and man, that is contained in the first branch, <hi>Faith. Order,</hi> which is the second and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite member, includes the exercise of <hi>Discipline</hi> and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, so far, as by rule they are expressed, and concern the rectifying of the carriage of such, who are in confoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration each with other.</p>
               <p>This word taken in its native and narrow signification, implies <hi>the right positure of things in their proper places and ranks,</hi> when they are marshalled by the rule of <hi>Method,</hi> according to their especiall precedencies and dependencies they have, each upon other. And here by a Metonimy of the Adjunct, The managing of all Church-Ordinances, according to all the <hi>formes thereof,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaks, the outgoings thereof, and incomings thereof, with that piety and spirituall prudence,<note place="margin">Ch. 43.11.</note> as is most sutable to all, that time, place, and persons, and practises, can require, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed by some, received by others, is understood.</p>
               <p>So that, when all offices and ordinances are managed in this manner, in a comely demeanour, the Church is then truely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly Militant, becomes <hi>terrible</hi> like a well ordered army with <hi>banners.</hi> But when you loose the ranks, and rout the company, by disorderly administrations, it is the overthrow of the Army, and so of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>House of Christ.]</hi> It is the expression of the Apostle in the place formerly quoted, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That thou maiest know how to behave thy self in the house of God, which is the Church
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111062:20"/> of the living God.</hi> God is the father of all the family in heaven and earth. Christ the Head and Redeemer, the holy Ghost the Comforter.</p>
               <p>As the Head, so the Church which is his Body, admits a double consideration.</p>
               <p>Christ is a Head,
<list>
                     <item>Mysticall, by Spirituall influence.</item>
                     <item>Politicall, by his especiall guidance in the means, and dispensation of his Ordinances.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Church also is a Body,
<list>
                     <item>Mysticall,</item>
                     <item>Politicall.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The mysticall Body is the Church of true Beleevers,</hi> who being effectually called by his word and spirit, by faith yeelding to the call, are spiritually united unto Christ, from whom, as from a head, all spirituall life and motion is communicated on his part, and received on theirs. And this takes up the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church,</hi> because the union, and so the relation, in the truth of it, is inward, and not to be seen by sense. <hi>Of this</hi> we do not now inquire. It is that we doe beleeve. <hi>The Politicall body or Church visible</hi> results out of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is betwixt the professours of the faith, when by voluntary consent they yeeld outward subjection to that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, which in his word he hath prescribed, and as an externall head exerciseth by his word, spirit, and discipline, by his ordinances and officers over them, who have yeelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves subjects to his Headship and supream Authority. For Christ having humbled himself to the death, the cursed death upon the crosse, God the Father hath given him a name,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.9. Joh. 13.3. Mat. 28.18 Joh. 5.22.</note> above every thing that is named. Hath given him all things: Hath committed all power into his hand: and hath delegated unto him, the immediate dispensation of this power. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man,</hi> and by a parity of reason, in a right sense, he calls quickens, rules no man, but hath committed the immediate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of all to the Sonne: which power he exerciseth invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in their hearts by the operations of his spirit: but exerciseth it visibly by his ordinances and officers in his Church, as upon his subjects, who professe allegiance and homage to him. So the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>When he ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, he gave gifts to men, some to be Pastors, some to be Teachers,</hi> all set in his Church, and all for the good of his Church.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111062:21"/>
               <p>And as he hath a golden Scepter for the guidance of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, so, as a Judge, he hath an iron rod to break his enemies in pieces like a potters vessell. <hi>Bring hither mine enemies,</hi> that will not have me <hi>to rule over them, and slay them before my face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence observe <hi>obiter</hi> and by the way, that the root of this power lieth first in Christ, as a Head, and is communicated by vertue of that commission received from the Father. <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given to me,</hi> therefore <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Baptise, Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19.</p>
               <p>We now see the proper and adequate subject about which ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall policy is exercised, to wit,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The affaires of his house,]</hi> The things that appertain to the visible Church, his visible Kingdome on earth. And to this place appertain the disputes, touching the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ecclesiasticall and civil Policy, what kinde of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have each into other, together with the tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call usurpation of that man of sinne, and the false claim that Antichrist makes to both the swords, with all the pretences he deviseth to serve his own turn, and the false colours he puts upon his proceedings, when he would allay his cruelty, with a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht device, as though he did all <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> and by the colour of that order, he might disorder and overturn the whole frame of all Kingdomes and commonwealths, if they will not stoop to his tyranny and usurpation.</p>
               <p>All those controversies take here their proper consideration, as in their proper place. But our intendment being to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things in short, we shall wholly leave such tedious disputes, which would trouble our work, and weary the Reader.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, Ecclesiasticall policy confines it self within the affairs of the Church, as within its proper compasse. <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>is not of this world;</hi> and so the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his Kingdome are spirituall weapons, as in the inference our Saviour fully concludes. If <hi>my Kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight,</hi> that I should not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Jews. But his Kingdome is not of this world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his servants will not fight.</p>
               <p>Men sustain a double relation.</p>
               <p>As members of the commonwealth they have civil weapons, and in a civil way of righteousnesse, they may, and should use them.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:111062:21"/>
               <p>But as members of a Church, their weapons are spirituall, and the work is spirituall, the censures of the Church are spirituall, and reach the souls and consciences of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the pattern of the Word.]</hi> This clause points where the laws of this Kingdom are to be found, and whence to be fetched. As <hi>Moses</hi> saw his pattern in the Mount, according to which he was to mold, all things in the Tabernacle: So we have ours left upon record in the holy Scriptures, unto which we must not adde, and from which we must not take any thing. Christ the King of his Church, and Master of his House, he only in reason, can make laws that are Authenticke for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
               <p>And here we shall take leave to stay a little, and make this ground good before we passe, because we shall have speciall use of it, as a main pillar to bear up the building, of the following discourse, against the cavils of Papists and Formalists.</p>
               <p>We shall first explicate, and then argue.</p>

                  <p>The ordinances which these are to dispense, as preaching, prayer, seals, Church-censures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all these are to be found in the word, and should be fetched from the word: and now under the Gospel, they are and ought to be the same; in all places, amongst all people, at all times, in all succeeding generations, untill the coming of Christ.</p>

               <p>It is not left in the power of persons, Officers, Churches, nor all states in the world, to add, or diminish, or alter any thing in the least measure.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.13 <hi>Iun. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi>
                  </note> But as God did appoint all in the Old Testament, and those his institutions, did endure their <hi>Ever</hi> (as the Scripture speaks) <hi>i.</hi> untill the coming of Christ, when the same power which appointed them, changed them, So in the New Testament where we are to expect no alteration,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111062:22"/> Christ the Law-giver he only appoints, none but he can, and he hath made known his will, that he will not change them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Circumstantialls</hi> of Discipline, as time, place, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of these dispensations in civill decencies, suitable to the quality of the things, and conditions of the time, as peace and persecution: the generall rules of these are in the word delivered: but the particular application admits varieties, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilities and alterations, according as necessities or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences shall appear by emergent occasions.</p>
               <p>That there is an immutable rule, touching the <hi>essentialls</hi> of discipline, left in the word, and thence to be fetched, we are now to prove.</p>

                  <q>

                  <p>The essentialls stand, either by the necessity of precept, and so immutably required, or else they are left arbitrary to the will of man to appoint.</p>
                  <p>But they are not left arbitrary.</p>
                  <p>The first part is evident by the fulnesse of the division.</p>
                  <p>All things spirituall are either Christian duties, or else are left to Christian liberty.</p>
                  <p>The second part is thus proved.</p>
                  <p>If it be not in man to inable an Officer to his work, or offices or Ordinances to attain their end: Then it is not in his power
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111062:22"/> to appoint Officer or Ordinance in the Church. For such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment should be crosse to wisdome in attempting it, and so frustrate in regard of the end, in not attaining it.</p>
                  <p>But it is not in man to inable to the work, or to make the Ordinance attain its end: because the work is spirituall, and the end supernaturall: And herein lies especially the difference betwixt civill and Ecclesiasticall power, <hi>Dominium</hi> and royall Soveraignty may be seated in the one, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; because they can communicate power from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to others, and inable others to attain civill ends, and to accomplish civill work, and in that respect they are called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>There is no man can have his Curate or Vicar, his Vicarius, because he is bound, in his own particular, to his place of Ministery: he can appoint none because he can give power to none.</p>

                     <hi>That which is a fundamentall point of Religion,</hi> that hath divine Institution, and so becomes immutable, unlesse Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self repeal it. For principles of that nature must have divine authority to appoint and to remove.</p>
                  <p>But Church Discipline is a fundamentall point of Religion. Heb. 6. <hi>Laying on of hands, being by a Metonymy of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct</hi> put for Ordination, Ordination one particular, put for the whole of Church Discipline.</p>

                  <p>Its that which the Lord condemns in Images, <hi>which tell lies,</hi> Its that which the Lord threatens to punish. <hi>Isa,</hi> 29.19. <hi>That his fear is taught by the precepts of men.</hi>

                  <p>Because such ceremonies are of the same kinde and homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall with the significative part of the actions of the Sacrament, and upon the ground may be said to have a reall and true efficacy of teaching, which properly is a part of worship: since that part of the Sacrament, which is placed in signification is so.

For its openly said by the Patrons thereof, <hi>to betoken the ingagement</hi> betwixt Christ and the child, that he shall be Christs servant, and souldier to follow his colours and fight under his banner unto his dying day. And this Image though it hath no tongue to speak of its own, yet it speaks by this instituted signification put upon it and pressed by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Prelates.</p>

                  <p>Those Ceremonies which are set in the same rank with Gods own Ceremonies, in regard of their end and use, As those are truly religious because God is the appointer of them: So these must be superstitious, because mans will is the Institutour of them: the parity and proportion of reason holds on both sides.</p>
                  <p>But significant Ceremonies thus instituted, are of the like nature with some of Gods own rites.

                  <p>There must be a right understanding of the meaning of the words, and so a <hi>Grammaticall Analysis</hi> of the phrase, where the promises or commands are expressed, before either our faith can believe the one, or a gracious, humble heart make choice aright of the other, and obey it.

                  <head>Of the Efficient.</head>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Principall cause</hi> and Institutour of a visible Church, there is a common concurrence of all sides, so far as I can reade, and therefore I shall ease the Reader of all large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>It shall be enough to point out the truth, as it is expressed in Scripture: namely, The institution of the Church issues from the speciall appointment of <hi>God the Father, thorow the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> as the head thereof, <hi>by the holy Ghost,</hi> sent and set on work for that end. So the Apostle speaks most pregnantly and plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.31. <hi>For this man</hi> (meaning <hi>Christ) was counted worthy of more honour then Moses, inasmuch as he that hath build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the house, hath more honour then the house. Christ is set over the Church,</hi> which is, <hi>the house of God, as the Sonne, Moses as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> He the master-builder, <hi>Moses</hi> as an Inferiour and under-workman. And <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>For every house is builded by some man, but he that buildeth all things is God.</hi> This <hi>ALL</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the things that went before, to wit, the <hi>things of the house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ever belongs to the Church hath God in Christ the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it. And hence in the old Testament it was given in charge to <hi>Moses,</hi> that as <hi>he saw</hi> all presented before him <hi>in the Mount,</hi> in a lively manner, so he must be cautelous and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious to hold himself to that patern, not to swerve an hairs breadth there-from, or to adde any thing of his own devising. And hence our Saviour claims this as his prerogative royall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>∆≤pon this rock I will build my Church.</hi> It is his house, and he knows his own minde, and therefore he only will fashion it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.<note place="margin">As M.<hi>R.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 10. Ezek. 43.11.</note> And from hence it is, that in the time wherein <hi>Ezekiel</hi> would limme out, and that unto the life, the <hi>Temple</hi> to be erected in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> he there laies out all the particulars by Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall appointment; The <hi>Outgoings</hi> and <hi>Incomings, Forms, Fashions, Laws</hi> thereof, and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>the Inferiour helping cause,</hi> viz, <hi>The Civil Magistrate,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:111062:25"/> how farre he may be said to have a hand in the erecting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, It is that which hath exercised the heads and pens of the most judicious, and is too large for this place, and our purpose, we willingly passe it by, being not yet perswaded that the chief Magistrate should stand a Neuter, and tolerate all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>

                     <head>Conclusion I.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parish precincts, or the abode and dwelling within the bounds and liberties of such a place, doth not give a man right, or make him mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fit for a visible Congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reason 1. <hi>No civil rule can properly convey over an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call right.</hi> The rules are <hi>in specie</hi> distinct, and their works and ends also, and therefore cannot be confounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Civil power</hi> hath a <hi>nourishing</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> faculty of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Orders, Officers, and their severall operations. <hi>Kings shall be nursing Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. But in their <hi>proper constitutions,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet. <hi>Imperare</hi> and <hi>praedicare</hi> are not compatible, hath been a ruled case, admitting no contradiction in an ordinary way: one is compleat, and hath all the causes without the other, and therefore one doth not receive his constitution in whole or in part from the other. Civil power may compell Ecclesiasticall persons to do, what they ought in their offices, but doth not confer their Offices upon them. The Kingdom of Christ is spirituall, and not of this world. That Proposition then is beyond controul. The second is open to experience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the taking up an abode or dwelling in such a place or precincts is by the rule of policy and civility.</hi> A man hath it by inheritance from his parents, or purchaseth it by his money, or receives it by gift or exchange. <hi>Ergo,</hi> This can give him no Ecclesiasticall right to Church-fellowship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. That right which any man hath in Church-fellowship, Excommunication out of a Church can, nay doth take away. For Excommunication is, according to the intent of the Word, The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111062:26"/>
                        <hi>cutting off</hi> from all Church-communion: and what ever right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had in his admission, is now disanulled by his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. <hi>Let him be as an Heathen,</hi> Mat. 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But Excommunication doth not, nor can take away a mans ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil right</hi> to the house and land, the civil priviledges he doth pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, or remove him from the right of his habitation, civil office or authority, he is invested in.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, <hi>That is no Ecclesiasticall right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. If Parish Precincts should have right to Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then Atheists, Papists, Turks and profane ones, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the truth and Church, yea men of strange Nations and languages, who neither know, nor be able to do the duties of Church-members, should be fit matter for a Church, because they have abode in such places: yea those should have right to whom Christ hath denied right, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27.</p>
                     <p>Much more might here be added, but that the tenet is so grosse, that I suppose any, seriously judicious, will see the errour of it.</p>

                        <hi>Saints</hi> as they are taken in this controversie, and in the currant expressions of Scripture, which look this way, and speak to this subject <hi>(Saints at Corinth, Saints at Philippi, at Rome, in Caesars house)</hi> were members of the Churches, comprehending the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of confoederate believers under their Parents Covenant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and such constant expressions of Saintship do intimate, that either <hi>they were such,</hi> or at least conceived to be <hi>such in view</hi> and <hi>in appearance.</hi> I say in <hi>appearance:</hi> for when the Scripture so terms and stiles men, we must know that <hi>Saints</hi> come under a double apprehension. <hi>Some</hi> are <hi>such</hi> according to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Some</hi> according <hi>to truth. Saints</hi> according to <hi>charity</hi> are such, who in their practice and profession (if we look at them in their course, according to what we see by experience, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by report and testimony from others, or lastly, look we at their expressions) <hi>they savour so much, as though they had been with Jesus. From all which,</hi> as farre as <hi>rationall charity</hi> directed <hi>by rule</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> a man cannot but conclude, That <hi>there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111062:26"/> may be some seeds of some spirituall work of God in the soul. These</hi> we call <hi>visible Saints</hi> (leaving <hi>secret things to God</hi>) in our view, and according to the reach of rationall charity, which can go no further, then to hopefull fruits. We say and <hi>hope,</hi> and so are <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>conceive they are Saints:</hi> though such be the secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, and hidden passages of hypocrisie, that they may be gilt, not gold, seemingly such only, not savingly, known to God and their own hearts, not known to others. So <hi>Judas, Demas, Simon Magus, Ananias,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with such, not <hi>as God</hi> who knows the heart, but in a <hi>Church-way,</hi> as those who judge the tree by the fruit. <hi>De occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis non judicat Ecclesia,</hi> That which the Church doth not see, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not censure. <hi>Some mens sins go before, &amp; some come after,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The STATE</hi> then of the <hi>Q∆≤ESTION</hi> is this. Persons, though they be hypocrites inwardly, yet if their conversations and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be such, so blamelesse and inoffensive, that according to <hi>reason</hi> directed by the <hi>Word,</hi> we cannot conclude, but in <hi>charity</hi> there <hi>may be, and is some speciall spirituall good</hi> in them; <hi>These are fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a visible Church</hi> appointed and allowed by Christ: and that for these Reasons.</p>

And that it is a visible politick body, appears quite thorow the whole Chapter, but especially, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. Because in <hi>that Church God sets Orders and Officers, Some Apostles, Teachers, Helpers, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The like to this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.12, 13. Where these <hi>Officers</hi> are, it is supposed there be <hi>visible</hi> concurrences of many <hi>Saints</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, both to <hi>choose</hi> such, and to <hi>subject</hi> unto such being chosen. Whence the Argument proceeds,
<q>
                              <p>The members of Christs body are fit alone to be members of a true Church, <hi>because that is the body of Christ,</hi> ex concessis.</p>
                              <p>But only visible Saints, who according to the rules of reasonable charity may be conceived to have some speciall good in them, are only members of Christs body.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>For to have a member, which nor doth, nor ever did receive any power or vertual impression of any operation in the kinde of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111062:27"/> it from the head, is not onely against reason, but against that <hi>reference and correspondence, which the members have to the head.</hi> Now visible Saints onely, according to former explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can be said by the rules of reasonable charity, to have some vertuall influence of some spirituall operation from Christ as a Head.</p>
                        <p>Therefore <hi>Such onely are members of a Church.</hi>

                        <q>But visible Saints <hi>(as formerly described)</hi> are onely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this kingdome.</q>
                        <p>Christ is the <hi>King of Saints</hi> (not of drunkards and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Athiests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they alone proclaim subjection in their practice: They onely attend to know and doe the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, or in case they swerve aside, and be carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares and unwittingly into conspiracie, yet are they willing to see, ready to yeeld, and come in again.

                        <p>If it be replied, that all these may be verified of cunning hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites not yet discovered.</p>
                        <p>I answer: The Argument leaves no place for the appearance of such an objection: for the terms in open expression are pointed directly against such, that in the judgement of charity were not Saints: and then the difference is exceeding wide. <hi>Those that are darknesse,</hi> and the <hi>servants of sin inwardly,</hi> may to the <hi>view of charity</hi> seem to <hi>be light,</hi> and servants of Christ <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and yet in <hi>charity</hi> be led by light.

                        <p n="1">1. <q>That the wicked are forbidden in case, so long as they hate to be reformed, but not simply: but this hinders not, but that they may be ordinary hearers, and so members of a visible Church.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I shall crave leave to <hi>reply</hi> severall things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The answer, in the 1. branch of it yeelds the cause, and grants all that was desired or intended, namely; <hi>while they hate to be reformed</hi> they have no title, which is all that is striven for: for if they come to see their sin, and to reform their evil waies, and give in evidence of their <hi>godly sorrow</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> then they are no longer haters of reformation, but true reformers and repentants in the judgement of charity, and then <hi>visible Saints,</hi> and fit to be made materialls in the temple, when the rubbish and unhewnnesse of their distempers are taken away. But while they remain haters, they have no title, <hi>ex concessis.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>that while,</hi> they are not visible Saints; which is all the argument required, and is now yeelded.</p>
                        <p>Whereas its added, <q>that it hence follows not, that they should not be ordinary hearers of the word.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer:</hi> It is true, it was never intended nor inferred; therefore the argument is untouched. For we say, as you, it doth not follow, nor need be required, for help either of the reason or the question. For let it be supposed, they may so doe, nay for ought we know, they should so doe, and we yet have what we would.</p>
                        <p>It is yet further added, <q>That being ordinary hearers and so members of a Church:</q> Such an expression I will not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how neer the cause it comes, I cannot but yet conceive, it is far from the truth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If ordinary <hi>hearing</hi> make a man a member, then <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> persons, who are cut off from membership, are members, for they may ordinarily hear; <hi>ex concessis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Then <hi>Turks, Papists,</hi> all sorts of contemners of the truth, <hi>Indians, Infidells,</hi> shall be members, for they may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111062:28"/> be, and in many places are ordinary hearers.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then in publique cities, where severall congregations meet, at severall houres, <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> man may be an ordinary hearer in them all, and so a man may be a member of three or four congregations.</p>
                        <p>The second thing M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>R.</hi> answers, is, <q>That this argument nothing concludes against them, because such adulterers, and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, which are forbid to take Gods law into their mouthes, are to be cast out: but the question is, if they be not cast out, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church for that be no true Church.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I say, The first part yeelds the cause again, for if they should be cast out, there is no reason they should be received or taken in, nor have they right thereunto, nor be they fit matter for that work.</p>
                        <p>The second clause doth wholly misse the mark again. For the question is, touching the <hi>constitution</hi> of a Church, of what matter it should be made, It is not touching <hi>separation</hi> from a Church: for the errour is in taking in such as be not fit. So that the argument is yet unanswered, yea by these answers, further confirmed.</p>
                        <p>So much may serve for the confirmation of the conclusion for the present, more shall be added in an opportune place.</p>
                        <p>But before we leave the conclusion, we shall make some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> from it, which may further help us in our proceedings and purpose in hand. Something hence may be collected for the discovery of sundry <hi>mistakes</hi> in the <hi>Separatists,</hi> wherein they <hi>go aside</hi> from the truth. Something observed, for <hi>to clear their</hi> way, wherein they go along with it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The two last inferences, are the <hi>Tenets</hi> of those of the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> not onely extreamly <hi>rigid,</hi> but very <hi>unreasonable.</hi> For if they be fit matter for publique communion, they are much more fit for private: But men are or should be visible Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come into Church fellowship, and are thereby fitted for it, and therefore much more fitted for private communion.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Something also may be observed</hi> to clear the way <hi>where</hi> they go along with the truth. <hi>Namely,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>Hence, They who hold <hi>visible Saints</hi> in the judgement <hi>of charity</hi> to be fit Matter, though they be not inwardly sanctified, cannot in reason be thought to maintain <hi>onely such, that be eff ctually called, justified, and sanctified,</hi> to be the <hi>onely matter</hi> of a rightly-constituted Church.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I could have heartily wished, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>Reut.</hi> would not have disputed against that which they freely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly grant, to wit, <q>
                              <hi>That</hi> hypocrites, because their falsenes is coloured and covered over with appearances of piety, and so cannot be censured (as not discovered) may be received into Church communion, without the breach of any rule, because the Church therein goeth according to the rule of charity, being bound to hope all to be good <hi>(upon grounds which shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards laid)</hi> which reason inlightned by rule cannot prove to be bad.</q> This is yeelded and therefore need not to have been proved.</p>
                        <p>But the pinch <hi>of the difference</hi> lieth in this,</p>
                        <p>Whether such as walk in a way of profannesse, or remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously obstinate in some wickednesse, though otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and practising the things of the Gospel, have any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Christ, or may be counted <hi>fit matter,</hi> according to the terms of the Gospel, to <hi>constitute a Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that which <hi>is controverted,</hi> and should have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by argument.

                        <p>It is true, The expressions of <hi>some</hi> of our <hi>brethren,</hi> as those also of the <hi>Separation,</hi> are somewhat narrow at the first sighe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111062:29"/> and seem to require exactnes in the highest strain: yet were they but candidely interpreted by the received principles, according to which they are known to proceed, they would carry a fair construction, to any brotherly conceiving: of this I speak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I doe observe, and I cannot but professe I doe observe it with trouble and grief, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>R.</hi> a man of such learning and sharpnesse of judgement, and in other things, and at other times of pious moderation, should yet so commonly, and frequently, and if I mistake not, without occasion offered many times, load the expressions of those, against whom he writes, with such a sense, that their own grounds, to his own knowledge, do directly oppose, and their own words, by an easie interpretation, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a contrary meaning.</p>
                        <p>I shall constrain my self therefore upon so just an occasion, to indeavour to clear this coast, that if it be the will of God, I may for ever silence <hi>misconceivings,</hi> or <hi>misinterpretations</hi> in this case: and therefore I shall labour,</p>

                           <q>Before I come to the point in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, I will lay down two cautions <hi>(saith he)</hi> for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of errour in the simple, and of cavelling, in such as desire to contend. <hi>1.</hi> It must be considered, that here the question is, about the visible or externall Church, which is by men discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not of that Church, which is internall and invisible, which onely the Lord knoweth, we speak here of visible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall holines onely, whereof men may judge, and not of that which is within and hid from mens eyes. For we doubt not, but the purest Church upon earth may consist of good and bad in Gods eye, of such that are truely sanctified and faithfull, and of such, who have onely for a time, put on the outside and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of sanctity, which the Lord will in due time pluck off, though in the mean time, mans dim sight cannot pierce through it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that we have expressions full. The Church consists of some who are faithfull and sincere hearted: Some counterfet and false hearted. Some really good, some really bad, onely those who appear so bad and vile should not be accepted. And doth not M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>R.</hi> say the same?</p>
                        <p>In the same place M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>Robins.</hi> addes. <q>I desire it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the question between M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                              <hi>Bern.</hi> and me, is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true and naturall members, whereof the Church is orderly gathered and planted, and not about the decaied and degenerate estate of the Church and members. For we know that naturall children may become rebellious, the faithfull city a harlot, the silver drosse, and the wine corrupt with water,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111062:30"/> the whole vine so planted, whose plants were all naturall, may degenerate into the plants of a strange vine.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The expressions are so plain that there needs no explication, nor can a man, that will deal candidly, mistake, unlesse one should set himself on purpose to pervert a writers meaning.</p>
                        <p>He that holds such may be received into the Church, who may degenerate from subjection and obedience, to rebellion, from faithfulnesse to falsenesse, from a profession pure and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in appearance and approbation of men, to a rotten, profane and unsavoury carriage: He must needs hold, that false, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and hollow hearted hypocrites may be members of a Congregation.</p>
                        <p>When therefore we meet with such phrases printed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Onely the Saints, faithfull, called, and sanctified are to be members of a Congregation,</hi> He must needs be exceeding weak, or exceeding wilfull, that will not easily and readily give such a construction as this, <hi>Namely, Persons visibly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally such to the judgement of Charity, not alwaies really and internally such by the powerfull impression of Gods grace.</hi> Let therefore such mistakes be for ever silenced in the mindes and mouths of such as are wise hearted and moderate. We have <hi>thus cleared the expressions</hi> of our <hi>Brethren of the Separation.</hi>

                        <p>Again 2. when M<seg rend="sup">‚Ä¢</seg>. <hi>R.</hi> thus writes, <hi>lib</hi> 2. p. 99, <q>The ignorants and simple ones among the Papists, have not rejected the Gospel obstinately in respect it was never revealed to them, yet the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorance of points principally fundamentall makes them a non-Church.</q>

                     <head>3. Conclusion,</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Churches constituted of fit matter may be corrupted by the breaking forth of scandals, and pestered with scandalous, persons which may fo far be tolerated, until in a judiciall way, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church be exercised upon them, according to the rule of Christ, and they thereby reformed or else removed and cut off from the body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be <hi>three branches</hi> in the conclusion, which hold forth evidence of truth at the first sight, and therefore we shall not stay long upon proof.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Churches rightly constituted may soon be corrupted,</hi>] the Scriptures are pregnant which testifie it, and experience is so plain, it is past gainsaying, at <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Sardis, Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. And above all, this is to be seen in the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> the canker of falsenesse in doctrine, and corruption in manners, had so far eaten into the very <hi>essence</hi> of the Church, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.2.9. that the Lord threatned her to give her <hi>a bill of divorce,</hi> and to cast her out of his sight as not his wife.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet in such declining times, when deseases grow deadly, there is allowed, and <hi>a toleration of necessity must be so far granted, untill</hi> Juridice <hi>by a judiciall proceeding the evil be examined, the parties convinced, censures applied for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] For the Ordinances of Christ and rules of the Gospel serve, not only for the <hi>constitution</hi> of a Church, but for the <hi>preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it. That is the main scope of our Saviour his government: first, to gain a sinner if it may be, <hi>for he came not to condemn
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111062:33"/> the world</hi> (men can condemn themselves fast enough) <hi>but to save it,</hi> and the censures of the Church are sufficient to recover the sick and deseased, as well as to nourish the sound.</p>
                     <p>And hence our Saviour requires time of triall, if they may be healed, and untill that be over, they must be tolerated. Cutting off is only used when things come to extremity. <hi>If he will not hear, let him be as an Heathen.</hi> &amp;c. Therefore had he heard and submitted to the censure of the Church, and been gained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to repentance and reformation, there had needed no further proceeding.</p>
                     <p>But in case they prove incorrigeable and irrecoverable by the physick used, they are then to be abandoned. <hi>Purge out the old leaven.</hi> 1 Cor. 5. cast out such an one.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is evident, the corrupting of a Church constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gives no allowance to bring in corrupt members to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Church, but the contrary, if a pertinacious mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should be removed by the rule of the Gospel, then such a one should not be admitted.</p>
                     <q>These Conclusions premised: the arguments of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.</hi> Rutt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the visibility of Saints to be right matter of a Church, will admit an easie answer.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is <hi>not only a professed willingnesse to receive the Gospel, but a practicall reformation,</hi> that in the judgement of charity gives <hi>ground of hope there is something reall, before the contrary appear.</hi> And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> who received <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> upon his approbation of the truth and outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereunto in the course of his life, when his practise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the contrary, the Apostle rejected him, as one in <hi>the gall of bitternesse and bond of iniquity,</hi> who had no share in Christ, and therefore certainly would not suffer him to share in the priviledges of communion, so persisting without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Argument. <q>If the visible Church be a draw-net, where are fish and filth: an house, where are vessells of silver and gold, and baser vessels of brasse and wood: Then in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111062:33"/> a Church rightly constituted, there may be beleevers and hypocrites.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The argument is wholly yeelded, and the cause not touched, much lesse concluded, as may appear by the state of the question taken in a right meaning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The like may be said to the third argument, touching the man that came to the wedding, not having on a wedding garment,</hi> for it seems by the text, he carried it so cunningly in appearance, that onely the <hi>Master of the feast</hi> perceived it, others did not discover it, before his coming in.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>three last arguments</hi> having one and the same bottom to bear them up, admit one and the same answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>If the</hi> Churches of Israel, Judah, Galatia, Sardis, Laodicea, were Churches truely constituted, and yet in them were many wicked, prophane, unclean; then visible Saints are not onely fit matter allowed by Christ to make up a visible Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>But they were Churches truely constituted, and yet had clean and unclean mixed among them. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>Answ. <hi>The consequence is denied,</hi> and the cause is given in the <hi>third conclusion,</hi> because such are onely by rule to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a time, untill the censures be tried upon them. But if then they prove incorrigible they are to be removed and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. So that the edge of the argument may be turned most cruely against the cause it would prove.</p>
                     <q>If in all these Churches the unclean and profane were to be excommunicated: Then such as they, were not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But by Gods command they were to be excommunicated.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore such as they were not to be admitted.</hi> Its certain <hi>Christ</hi> allows the Toleration of some in the Church for a time, whom he doth not allow to be taken in as fit matter to make up a Church.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>rest of his Arguments</hi> propounded in his second book. <hi>p.</hi> 251. labour of the <hi>same mistake,</hi> and the <hi>like answer</hi> releeves the reader without the least trouble. For let him carry the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions formerly propounded along with him in his considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and refresh his memory with the <hi>caveat</hi> and <hi>caution</hi> that was put in by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>Robinson,</hi> when I cleared the opinion of those our <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Separation;</hi> That our Question is not, whether members now received, and visible Christians in the eye of charity may so degenerate and break out into scandalous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111062:34"/> and apostasies, that they may be scandalous, and that grossely: But the Question is, whether in the orderly gathering of the Church, such according to the way and warrant of Christ can, and ought to be received.</p>
                     <p>And therefore to dispute, The Church now gathered hath wicked and ungodly in it, and such as be not visible Saints: Therefore it may be gathered of such, is so broad unconsequence, and makes the Church door so wide, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>R.</hi> his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will proclaim it to be the broad way that leads crosse to the tenure of the Gospel. For I would make a collection, that shall carry a parity of reason with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

                     <p>Therefore such as be openly scandalous may be received into the visible Church.</p>
                     <p>And this doth not only set open the Church door, but pulls down the Church-side, and its that which M. <hi>R.</hi> himself gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saies, and that professedly and <hi>in terminis.</hi> lib. 2. p. 251.

                        <hi>His fourth argument</hi> taken from the 3000. in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His fifth.</hi> is <hi>p.</hi> 253. Thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If we are to bear one anothers burthen, and so fulfill the law of Christ, and if grace may be beside many sins, yea if <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his profession was esteemed sufficient for to give him bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: Then it is not required, that all the members of the visible Church, be visible Saints, as before explicated.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>consequence</hi> fails, for all this may be, namely, there may be many weaknesses, and yet visible expressions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to reasonable charity, and it is certain there were such in <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> For what <hi>Peter</hi> exacted at the hands of those, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized;</hi> he would and did follow
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111062:34"/> the rule of Christ which he had received and delivered to others, and therefore required as much at his hands.</p>
                     <p>The examples of <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the one breaking out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open persecution, the other into toleration of grosse Idolatry, are here very impertinent, and prejudiciall to M.<hi>R.</hi> his own defence and confession: For if such as these may be received; then openly scandalous may be entertained, which he denies, <hi>ubi supra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>sixth argument</hi> is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If onely visible Saints should be received, then we are not onely to try our selves, but to examine and judge carefully one another, and that every one must labour to be satisfied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science anent the regeneration one of another.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> M.<hi>R.</hi> maintains we should be satisfied in the judgement of charity that persons are such: for he holds, <q>
                           <hi>1.</hi> that we must beware they be not scandalous. <hi>2. They must be</hi> such as may be baptized by the order of Christ; <hi>and these must repent and professe their faith in the Lord Jesus. 3. They must be</hi> such as by their profession must notifie they be true beleevers, <hi>ut supra.</hi>

                        <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 196. Therefore, They must try and examine them that they be such, and these grounds give warrant thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Argument <hi>seventh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If many be brought and called to the visible Church on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose both in Gods revealed intention in his word to convert them; and in the Churches, that they may be converted: Then the Church doth not consist of those who are professed converts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>proposition</hi> fails. Those who are <hi>converts in the judgement of charity,</hi> may yet in Gods intention be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, that they may be truely converted.</p>
                     <p>But if he mean, that the Church doth of purpose receive them into the Church to be converted, then it is crosse to his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and a person may be received to the seals of the Covenant, who doth not notifie that he hath faith, nay the Church may receive them to the seals, whom she knows have no right to the seals; for she knows they are not invisible members, which in M. <hi>R.</hi> his judgement onely gives them right.</p>
                     <q>Having thus cleared our way, We shall take leave in few words, to take into further consideration and examination <hi>some expressions</hi> of M. <hi>R.</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 99. <hi>l.</hi> 1. where neer the end he hath these words.</q>

                           <hi>By setled preaching of the word]</hi> Is meant a constant opening and applying the Scriptures in one place to one people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By mark]</hi> Is meant, not any <hi>common accident</hi> or <hi>adjunct</hi> which doth indifferently agree to other things, as well as the Church, for then it could never be said to <hi>notifie the Church,</hi> in that it may notifie many things besides. But it must be a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing</hi> and <hi>distinguishing note,</hi> and therefore it must be <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> as they call it, and <hi>inseparable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These things confessed, which received rules of reason evince; I thence dispute.</p>

                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:111062:36"/>That which is separable from the Church, and common to something beside that, cannot be a note of the Church.</q>
                        <p>This is evident from the right explication of the terms.</p>
                        <q>But setled preaching of the word, and constant opening and applying the Scripture to one people, in one place, is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Church.</q>
                        <p>As suppose a Minister should preach many years, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Infidels in one place. Nay suppose a lecturer speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to a company of people, which resort from severall Churches, unto the same Auditory.</p>
                        <p>Here is <hi>setled preaching,</hi> and yet here is <hi>no Church;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>this is a seperable adjunct, and no note.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be <hi>replied,</hi> that you must consider setled preaching, <hi>as</hi> established and remaining <hi>in the Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To that the <hi>answer</hi> is; This plea is yet too narrow, to cover the nakednesse and weaknesse of this assertion. For upon this grant, the dispute must follow one of these two waies. The <hi>setled</hi> preaching of the word taken <hi>with the Church,</hi> is a mark of the <hi>Church:</hi> and this is irrationall, to make the <hi>Church a mark of it self.</hi> Or the meaning must be this; Setled preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>whilst it remains in the Church,</hi> is a <hi>note</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> but this nothing helps, for the inference remains as feeble as before. For if such a setled preaching be but a common adjunct or separable accident, in the nature of it, let it be where it will be, it will never, nay it can never be <hi>a proper</hi> note to that thing, as <hi>Sensitiva facultas in homine,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>mark of a man,</hi> though <hi>in a man.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III. Of the Invisible Church.</hi> Whether the Invisible Church be the principall, prime, and onely proper subject, to whom all the Seals, and priviledges of speciall note doe belong?</head>
               <p>MAster <hi>R. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 242. <hi>distinct.</hi> 3. Is pleased to suggest a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>advertisement</hi> unto us, which being well considered, many of our erroneous mistakes, (as he saies,) may seasonably be recovered, and we brought thereby to a right understanding of the things of Christ.</p>
               <p>Among other of my Brethren, I doe professe my scope in this inquiry, to be onely this, to see the way of truth, and to walk therein: and therefore shall gladly lend a willing ear to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and advise, that our errours being thereby discovered, we may see and shun them for time to come.</p>
               <p>That particular truth, which will be like a sea-mark to teach us how to steer our course and compasse aright, is by him thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE INVISIBLE CH∆≤RCH CATHOLIKE is the principall, prime, <hi>and</hi> native subject of all the priviledges of Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the CH∆≤RCH VISIBLE, as she is such, is no waies such a subject: the non-consideration whereof we take to be the ground of many errors in our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren in this matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is his seasonable warning, unto which I readily attend: and because I would not <hi>creare molestias, &amp; serere lites sine caus√¢:</hi> I shall crave leave to make inquiry into two things, wherein my stick is most, that being convinced and satisfied in them, I shall readily sit down in silence, and submit to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of better reason, then mine own.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whether the invisible Church be the principall, prime, and onely subject of the Seals of the Covenant?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Whether the holding of this conclusion will necessarily make us forsake our doctrine touching that power we give to the people, and our assertions of Independency and congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Churches.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:111062:37"/>
               <p>I choose to restrain the proposition to that particular mentioned, because there appears the greatest difficulty, to my dimme and shallow apprehension. As also because the <hi>through explication</hi> of this which is most familiar, will of n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>cessity force and draw in with it a reall consideration of the rest.</p>
               <p>That I may be plain and punctuall in our proceeding, I shall take leave, and I hope without offence, to set down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Invisible Catholike Church, is not the prime and onely subject of the Seals, and therefore not of all priviledges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> by any argument that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>R.</hi> hath here alledged for proof or confirmation hereof.</p>
               <p>When I say, the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>onely subject,</hi> I understand the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, according to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

               </p>
               <p>Though his exposition of the rule is neither safe nor sound, yet it is a safe ground in dispute to take principles in that sense and meaning, which is confessed by him, with whom we dispute.</p>
               <p>To come to the matter in hand, I shall endeavour two things.</p>

                  <item>2. I shall propound <hi>such arguments</hi> as I have, which wholly hinder for the while, from entertaining this opinion.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Externally those are within the covenant,</hi> who expressing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111062:37"/> their repentance, with their profession of the truth, ingage themselves to walk in the waies of God, and in the truth of his worship, though they have not for the present that sound work of Faith in their hearts, and may be shall never have it wrought by Gods spirit in them.</p>
                     <p>And of persons thus in covenant the Apostle speaks in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and that to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>R.</hi> his apprehensions elswhere, as it will appear easily to any, who will weigh the context.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That being in Covenant is here understood, which was visible and intelligible to the Apostle, according to the grounds of judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charity,</hi> otherwise the Apostles counsell had not been of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to carry them to the practice of Baptisme, if he had given them direction upon a misconceived ground: nor had they reason to have followed his direction. For the reply had been easie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Invisible</hi> Christians have only right to Seals: But whether we be such, we for the present doe not know: and its certain, you can neither see, nor know, for truth of grace is invisible to man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the being externally in Covenant, is thus intelligible by the Apostle,</hi> therefore this is here attended.</p>
                     <p>The first is proved, and the <hi>second is as plain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Invisible works of grace,</hi> which doe <hi>make</hi> the Church <hi>Invisible,</hi> are to be beleeved, cannot be seen, nor come within any certainty of humane knowledge, And this is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in the generall, but acknowledged also to be meant in this place. 3000. were added to the Church, who could not all be approved, to the consciences one of another to be true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>
                     <p>Clear then it is from the <hi>scope</hi> of the place, the ground of the Apostles counsel, and the nature of the promise here expressed, 1. That being <hi>externally in covenant</hi> is here attended. 2. That such a being in covenant doth <hi>give right</hi> unto the <hi>Seales,</hi> else <hi>the frame of the Apostles reason and counsell</hi> had fallen to the ground.</p>
                     <p>The proposition thus cleared, the Minor is to be denied as false: and the contrary tenet, <hi>That only the Invisible Church hath right to the Seals,</hi> will draw unavoidable difficulties with it, and give such advantages to the <hi>Adversaries of Gods grace,</hi> and the dispensation of <hi>his Ordinances,</hi> that they will hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:111062:38"/>
                     <p>We are compassed about by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>R.</hi> in this ch. <hi>l.</hi> 2. p. 247. with a croud of accusations, to hold <hi>one</hi> of the grossest of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Popish, Socinian Doctrines:</hi> and upon all occasions we hear <hi>Ad nauseam us{que},</hi> of our sodering with the errours of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Catch. Cracov. Nicholaides.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How justly,</hi> we have in part touched, and shall add something in the season thereof.</p>
                     <p>But I would be loath any of our tenets maintained professedly by us (not fathered upon us injuriously,) should lay such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone to build up the wretched doctrine of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as this of his doth.</p>
                     <p>For let M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>R.</hi> help us to answer the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> upon his grounds, thus reasoning.</p>
                     <p>Those, that I cannot know have any right to the Seals, to them I cannot give the seals of the Covenant <hi>in faith</hi> as the Apostle cals <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I cannot know that Infants are of the Invisible Church, which only gives them right to the seals.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I cannot of Faith give the seals to them.</p>
                     <p>If M <hi>R.</hi> will grant them the <hi>proposition, that they may give the seals unto such, whom they cannot know have any right to them,</hi> They will go away <hi>triumphing,</hi> as well they may. For they have such a hold, that all the battery of the strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not able to drive them from.</p>
                     <p>If M. <hi>R.</hi> help the <hi>minor</hi> with a distinction which he useth, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. in the variation. p. 185.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Faith in Christ truly giveth right unto the seals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in Gods intention and decree, called <hi>voluntas bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placiti,</hi> they belong only unto the invisible Church: But the orderly way of the Churches giving the Seals is, because such a society is a professing or visible Church, and the orderly giving of the Seals according to Gods approving will, called <hi>voluntas signi &amp; revelata,</hi> belong to the visible Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This salve is too narrow for the sore. For the distinction will either make God order the <hi>giving of the Seals,</hi> to such who have <hi>no right,</hi> and so impeach his <hi>wisdome,</hi> to appoint the giving of the seals to such, to whom he gives no right to receive them: or else it doth <hi>implicare</hi> plainly, and the severall expressions contain apparent contradictions. For this <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> which allows the Church visible to give the Seals, it either gives <hi>another</hi> right <hi>besides</hi> that which the invisible members have, or else it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111062:38"/> gives no right. If it give <hi>another right.</hi> then the invisible Church hath <hi>not only right,</hi> which is here affirmed. If it give <hi>no right</hi> then the <hi>visible</hi> Church doth give the Seals <hi>orderly to such who have no right to them,</hi> as far as we can see: which was beforc denied in the grant of the proposition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quid plura?</hi> I must confesse such is my feeblenesse, that I cannot see how this can be avoided. For ask the question, How come hypocriticall professours to have right unto the Seals? As members of the visible Church they can have no right: they are the very words of M. <hi>R.</hi> p. 249. <q>The visible Church as the visible Church, hath no right unto the Seals, therefore they as visible have no right.</q> And <hi>Invisible</hi> members they are not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can have no right that way. Either then the Church must give them <hi>no seals;</hi> or else give them seals, when <hi>she cannot know</hi> they have any right, for indeed they have none, since of the invisible Church they are not, whereby they may claim a right: and being only of the visible Church, she can give no right: and so she administers seals orderly to such who have no right any waies to them: and this an <hi>order without order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For these reasons now expressed it is, that I cannot see weight enough in M. <hi>R.</hi> his arguments to perswade my judgement to be satisfied in the proof.</p>
                     <p>Having then gained so much, that in a true sence it is a truth that the visible Church is within the Covenant, and hath right to the Seals, according to the warrant which God hath left in his word: Let us in short inquire</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether there is not allowance given us in the woud, to give to the Church visible titles of speciall note;</hi> and this also is an especiall priviledge, which is by M. <hi>R.</hi> denied to the visible Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Its called <hi>the flock, or Church, redeemed by the bloud of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its stiled the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this in a savoury sense (according to <hi>former</hi> and familiar <hi>explication,</hi> speaking still according to the <hi>Judgement of charity,</hi> which is the only line, according unto which our conceivings are to be led) is safe and true.</p>
                     <p>The first is expressed, and to my apprehension, with as much evidence, as can be desired. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Attend to the whole
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111062:39"/> flock.</hi>

                        </gap>, <hi>to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Church</hi> here is according to us, <hi>Congregationall:</hi> to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>R.</hi> its <hi>Presbyteriall.</hi> But take it either way, it must needs be <hi>visible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That over whom Elders and Officers are set to attend and fed, by doctrine and discipline, this must needs be a visible Church.</hi> For unlesse they did see them and know them, how could they execute censures upon them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But THESE are called the Church redeemed with the bloud of God,</hi> then which stile, none can be more glorious.</p>
                     <p>If any man say that the elect and invisible are <hi>only</hi> there <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by that name. I <hi>answer.</hi> That conceit is crosse to the very grain of the words, and the scope of the text, For they must attend <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>to the whole flock.</hi> The charge puts no difference betwixt <hi>person</hi> and <hi>person,</hi> nor must their care be different. Nay upon this ground the Elders should not know what their care was, nor upon whom they should bestow it. For they might reply, Lord, we cannot search into thy secrets, to perceive who <hi>are elect and invisible Saints;</hi> we cannot discern them, and therefore we cannot tell <hi>how</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> them: whereas by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and common sense of the Scriptures, taking <hi>redeemed</hi> and <hi>sanctified</hi> as <hi>visibly,</hi> though not <hi>really</hi> such, the stream of the text runs pleasantly, without the least appearance of a doubt.</p>
                     <p>Its called the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.27.28.</p>
                     <p>These evidences of truth once taken in and entertained, A way is readily made to the right understanding of <hi>all</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> R. <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> so far as they seem to crosse any opinion and practice of ours.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, Those heavy Inditements which are laid and pleaded against us, will be wiped away with a wet finger, For hence it follows,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>A Church may be visibly in Covenant, which hath not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assistance, but may erre in Fundamentals: which may fall away, and not indure as the daies of heaven. And that is his <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fifth Argument.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>A Church may be visibly redeemed by the blood of God, and be called the body of Christ be stiled by the name of Sons and daughters of God, and yet not be really and inwardly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111062:39"/> such: which is his second Argument.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The third is answered before.</p>
                     <p>A Church may be visibly redeemed and taught outwardly by the spirit of Christ, as he is <hi>Politicall Head</hi> of his Church, which was never taught inwardly, nor effectually brought home to Christ, which is <hi>his last Argument.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence again all those heavy inditements which are charged upon us, are wiped away, nay they melt away of themselves before the explication of this holy truth of God, as snow before the heat of the Sun.</p>
                     <q>They who hold a <hi>visible Church</hi> to be <hi>externally within the Covenant,</hi> and the redeemed ones of God, his sons and daughters, to be his body and house, of <hi>which Christ is the Head and husband in A VISIBLE MANNER:</hi> They cannot be said, by the inference of any right reason, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: <hi>That Christ died for all such in Gods intention,</hi> Or, <hi>That all such are chosen to glory:</hi> Or, That <hi>God intendeth to save all such;</hi> There is not a colour of any <hi>consequence</hi> from such a ground, to make good such a conclusion.</q>
                     <p>We have done with the <hi>first</hi> thing, which we propounded, namely, I have shewed the Reason, why M. <hi>R.</hi> his proof doth not evince the cause for which it is brought.</p>

                        <hi>R.</hi> to confute that opinion, or to bring us out of it. For the holding of one errour will not help a person to see, much lesse recover him out of another.

                     <p>But that which caries greatest weight with me, is,

               </head>
               <p>WE have done with the <hi>Materiall</hi> cause of a visible Church: and we have seen that such as be <hi>visible Saints</hi> make up that.</p>
               <q>We are now come to consider of the <hi>Formall</hi> cause, <hi>that</hi> which <hi>makes</hi> the Church to be that which <hi>it is</hi> and gives the <hi>specificall nature</hi> (as we use to speak) thereunto.</q>
               <p>For take <hi>all</hi> the <hi>faithfull</hi> whether they be seemingly or sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, <hi>scattered up and down</hi> the face of the whole earth, these are but like scattered stones in the street, or timber felled in the woods, as yet there is neither <hi>wall</hi> made up, nor frame erected.</p>
               <p>They who be <hi>sincere</hi> are truly said to be the <hi>mysticall</hi> body of Christ, built upon him by a saving faith, and so injoy <hi>union</hi> to, and <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>head:</hi> But they cannot (to common sense) be thought to make up a <hi>visible communion</hi> when they are, not only <hi>severed</hi> one from another, but it may so fall out, as in times of persecution, they may be wholly <hi>unknown</hi> each to the other.</p>
               <p>This Invisible communion by faith makes up the <hi>Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant</hi> taken <hi>mystically,</hi> and it is but <hi>one</hi> in all the world: But the <hi>Church</hi> we are to attend, must be <hi>visible: so may as may come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet together in one place, who as they have the right to all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, so they may enjoy the use of them in Christ his order: and so they must be, and accordingly are stiled many.</hi> The <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of <hi>Judaea,</hi> of <hi>Galatia.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

<q>Mutuall covenanting and confoederating of the Saints in the fellowship of the faith according to the order of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is that which gives constitution and being to a visible Church.</q>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. An <hi>Implicite</hi> Covenant preserves the true <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> Church, because it caries the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederation in it, by which a <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>constituted.</hi> For <hi>Implicite</hi> and <hi>Explicite</hi> are but <hi>adjuncts,</hi> and these <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> from the <hi>essence.</hi> And therefore <hi>the essence and being of the covenant may consist with either.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. In <hi>some cases</hi> an <hi>Implicite</hi> covenant may be fully <hi>sufficient.</hi> As, suppose a whole congregation should consist of such, who were children to the parents now deceased, who were confoederate: Their <hi>children</hi> were true members accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Gospel, by the profession of their fathers covenant, though they should not make any <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall</hi> and <hi>vocall</hi> expression of their ingagement, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did.</item>
                     <item>3. Its most according to the <hi>compleatnesse of the rule,</hi> and for the better being of the Church, <hi>that there be an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite covenant.</hi> For

                           <item>1. Thereby the <hi>judgement</hi> of the members comes to be informed and convinced of their <hi>duty</hi> more fully.</item>

                           <item>2. They are thereby <hi>kept</hi> from cavilling and starting aside from the <hi>tenure</hi> and <hi>terms</hi> of the covenant, which they have professed and acknowledged, before the Lord and so many witnesses.</item>
                           <item>3. Thereby their hearts stand under a <hi>stronger tye,</hi> and are <hi>more</hi> quickned and <hi>provoked to doe that,</hi> which they have before God and the congregation, <hi>ingaged</hi> themselves to doe.</item>

                  <p>Hence also that <hi>question</hi> receives its explication and answer namely.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How far this covenant requires cohabitation?</hi>

                        <hi>Cohabitation</hi> in the <hi>same strictnes</hi> is <hi>not</hi> required, nor can be attended by <hi>all</hi> in the same manner: but if the <hi>speciall calling</hi> in some, or the <hi>publike</hi> behalf of the Church in others, doe call for <hi>some exceptions,</hi> without the <hi>prejudice</hi> of the exercise of <hi>publike ordinances</hi> (ut supra) such <hi>exceptions</hi> may, nay in truth, should <hi>be granted.</hi> For the <hi>policy</hi> of the Church and <hi>other rules,</hi> as they are not in <hi>nature,</hi> so they should not in their <hi>use</hi> be in <hi>opposition,</hi> but in <hi>subordination,</hi> each to other.</p>
                     <p>Instance. <hi>Merchants</hi> whose imploiments are in far countries, and as the 107. <hi>Psal.

                     <p>Hence upon the same ground the Church may send out <hi>some,</hi> either to begin plantations, in case the body require it, or to help on some others who want able guides to succour them in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, before they can attain a Church-state.

                     <p>The first is taken from that <hi>resemblance</hi> which this policy hath with <hi>all other bodies politick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Every spirituall or Ecclesiasticall corporation receives its being from a spirituall combination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the visible Churches of Christ, are Ecclesiasticall or spirituall corporations,</hi> Therefore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The first part of the Argument,</hi> hath reason and common sense to put it beyond gainsaying. Each whole or intire <hi>body,</hi> is made up of his members, <hi>as,</hi> by mutuall reference and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>they are ioyned</hi> each to the other. Thus <hi>Corporations</hi> in towns and cities, as they have their <hi>charter</hi> granted from the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> which gives them warrant and allowance to unite themselves to carry on such works, for such ends, with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: so their mutuall <hi>ingagements</hi> each to other, to attend such <hi>terms,</hi> to walk in such <hi>orders,</hi> which shall be sutable to such a condition, gives <hi>being</hi> to such a <hi>body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its that <hi>sement</hi> which soders them all, that <hi>soul</hi> as it were, that acts all the parts and particular persons so interested in such a way, for there is no man constrained to enter into such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unlesse he will: and he that will enter, must also willingly binde and ingage himself to each member of that society to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of the whole, or else a member actually he is not.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>polished</hi> and <hi>hewn stones</hi> prepared with great comelinesse and conveniency, gives yet <hi>no being</hi> to a <hi>house</hi> unlesse they be <hi>conioyned</hi> and <hi>compacted</hi> together, and thence the whole frame comes to be constituted and made up.</p>
                     <p>It is so with every particular Church rightly gathered. It is

                     <p>
                        <q>A <hi>Church in an Iland</hi> is a <hi>little city,</hi> a <hi>little kingdome</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
                        </q> Being then spirituall cities and corporations, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers must contain in them all the essentials which make up the whole. <hi>Visible Saints</hi> being the <hi>matter,</hi> this their <hi>union</hi> and <hi>combination</hi> must make up the Form.</p>

                     <p>The second part or Assumption is evident by the course of processe and proceeding which our Saviour prescribes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>If thy Brother offend</hi> &amp;c. where we have a <hi>legall</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> way laid forth by our Saviour, in which brethren <hi>only of the same Church,</hi> ought to deal one with another, which they <hi>cannot</hi> exercise with <hi>Infidels,</hi> nor yet with <hi>other Christian,</hi> as our own <hi>experience</hi> if we will take a tast, will give in undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence.</p>
                     <p>I may as a Christian, meeting with an offensive carriage in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>rebuke</hi> him for it: But if he will not hear me, shall I call in one or two, <hi>he departs the place,</hi> refuseth to come.

                     <p>Again he affirms <hi>Christum generaliter loqui si frater in te peccaverit</hi> &amp;c. if therefore the pastour, the teacher, if <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Archippus,</hi> be <hi>frater,</hi> Each brother hath as good law against <hi>Archippus,</hi> as <hi>Archippus</hi> hath against him, and the proceeding must be the same.

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But happily it will be replied: <hi>Whitaker</hi> disputes of a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell,</hi> what power that hath over the Pope, not of a <hi>particular Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True he doth so. but it is as true that he gives a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable power to a particular Church: hear his words and let the impartiall reader then weigh them. <hi>Ergo fateamur opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, per</hi> Ecclesiam, <hi>corpus multorum, non unum episcopum, coetum hominum, non unum aliquem hominem intelligere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to remove all doubt, that can be made, he adds. <hi>Et si particularis quae{que} Ecclesia maiorem habeat authoritatem in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicijs, quam Petrus, vel quivis homo particularis, tunc mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t√≤ magis universalis Ecclesia quae in concilio generali repraesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I add once more, Take it of a generall councell, and this will yet lend no relief to the answer in the least measure.</p>
                     <p>Every member of the generall councell hath power in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of a delinquent (In M. <hi>R.</hi> judgement) that is, in passing a censure or sentence in the councell.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:111062:45"/>
                     <p>But brethren or lay-men (as they are termed) are members of a generall councell. Therefore,</p>
                     <p>Each Brother hath power to censure a brother in case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> then of this second Argument is found and firm.</p>

Severall christian men come from far, into places, where Churches are planted. By what right or power can this Church charge or challenge him to sit down in that society? or by what duty is he bound to close with them in that way? As it was in his liberty to come into that place, and amongst that people: so it is in his liberty to change that place, and go to another people, to refuse this, and choose to member with another Congregarion.</p>
                     <p>In a word, <hi>If they have no power over him without this, then if they have any, it is by this.</hi>

                     <p>IF <hi>there be a Church,</hi> and so members before <hi>Baptisme:</hi> then <hi>Baptisme cannot give the formality.</hi> Because <hi>forma</hi> is causall, and so is in <hi>nature</hi> before <hi>formatum.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For Ministers are before baptisme:</hi> else Baptisme may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred lawfully by such, who are not <hi>Rulers, Pastors</hi> or <hi>Teachers</hi> which is denied by all Orthodox Divines, and I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not, but by M.<hi>R.</hi> And there must be a <hi>Church of beleevers</hi> to <hi>choose</hi> a <hi>Minister</hi> lawfully. For none but a <hi>Church</hi> can give him a call, and without a Call he cannot administer.</p>
                     <p>To this M.<hi>R. answers. l.</hi> 2. p. 219.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is false that the Church ministeriall, which only can bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, is before the Officers for they should then be before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which is absurd.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which the <hi>reply</hi> is easy.</p>
                     <p>That we speak not now of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Ministeriall,</hi> or as <hi>totum Organicum,</hi> but as <hi>totum essentiale,</hi> which is before <hi>Organicum.</hi> therefore the argument is wholly untouched: nor doth the answer reach the reason at all, it secretly confutes it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111062:47"/> self and confirms the cause. For, If <hi>Baptisme</hi> cannot be before a <hi>Ministeriall Church,</hi> nor that before a Church congregationall, which must make choice of a ministery, then such a Church is much before Baptisme.</p>
                     <p>Beside let it be supposed that at the coming of some godly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Christian and schollar into the country, and a company of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> (many) are converted to the faith, I ask whether these may not joyn in a Church-fellowship, and choose that man Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and whether that choice was not lawfull according to God? Therefore here is a <hi>Church</hi> before a <hi>Minister,</hi> and so before <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>If Baptisme give the form</hi> to visible membership, <hi>then while that remains valid the party is a visible member.</hi> for where the <hi>form</hi> is, the <hi>formatum</hi> must needs be, if the principles of reason may take place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But there is true Baptisme resting in the party, who hath no visible membership:</hi> as in an <hi>excommunicate,</hi> in him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the fellowship of the Church, or when the Church is utterly dissolved then all Church-membership ceaseth. for <hi>Relata mutuo se ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> And yet Baptisme is valid.</p>

                        <p>
                           <q>This is against yourselves and doth as well prove that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is not a seal of the covenant of grace, For an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate person may remain externally without the visible Church, when baptisme remaineth a seal, and may be a seal of grace or priviledge, which is interrupted or removed in <hi>act,</hi> but remaineth in <hi>habit.

                        <head>Reply.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>first part</hi> of the <hi>Answer</hi> is no whit satisfactory, nor doth remove the force of the Argument. For let it be granted that an excommunicate person may remain externally without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to the judgement of the visible Church, and yet Baptisme be a seal of it, because <hi>Baptisme</hi> is but a <hi>separable adjunct</hi> unto the <hi>Covenant</hi> whose efficacy may be hindered (and therefore the spirituall good) by the unworthinesse of the receiver, though in its own nature, its the end of baptisme to do that, and as much
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111062:47"/> as in it lieth, doth and would doe it, but the act of it is hindered by the wickednesse and unworthinesse of the receiver.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>reason</hi> is far <hi>otherwise, when Baptisme is made the form of membership,</hi> and therefore the inference will be far other, namely,</p>
                        <p>Though a <hi>separable adjunct</hi> may be severed from his <hi>subiect;</hi> or the <hi>effect thereof</hi> (which often is) may be hindered: yet its never heard that the <hi>form</hi> of a thing could be and remain in its full <hi>vigour,</hi> and the <hi>formatum not</hi> to be. If to be the <hi>eldest</hi> son of a <hi>King,</hi> had given the formality of the possessing of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that could never have been taken away: but he should have <hi>stood possessed</hi> thereof. But so it is not in case some <hi>notorious fault</hi> disinherit him, onely <hi>that</hi> makes him <hi>capax subiectum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot√®,</hi> but that which gives the <hi>formality</hi> of possession, is an <hi>heir well-deserving.</hi>

                        <p>This <hi>answer</hi> which should maintain the cause doth fully <hi>yeeld it,</hi> For if Church and Church-membership be <hi>relata secundum esse,</hi> and yet <hi>baptisme</hi> comes not within that compasse, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>it</hi> gives not the <hi>formality</hi> to Church-membership; and that upon a double proof.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. If Baptisme give the <hi>formale</hi> to <hi>membership,</hi> it then stands in the same kinde <hi>of relation,</hi> as Church-membership doth, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>specificall</hi> and proper <hi>being to membership.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, Let it be yeelded that Baptisme and Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are not so perfect relatives, for that we question not, but that (which is granted) <hi>it is forma,</hi> and then <hi>forma &amp; forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mutu√≤ se ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi>

                        <p>That of the <hi>Burgesse ticket,</hi> if it seal nothing of his city-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to him, it remains a <hi>writing,</hi> but no <hi>Authoritative</hi> means of freedome, and therefore not a <hi>formale of his freedome.</hi> For if it had given him his Burgesse-ship, the corporation would have provided for the <hi>taking away of that</hi> at the first, as well as the taking away <hi>of his liberty.</hi> As the <hi>King</hi> sends for the broad Seal, when he will out the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> of his power and place.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We shall first inquire the <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> and the intendment of M. <hi>R.</hi> and so lay down the <hi>state</hi> thereof in the severals of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then give in our <hi>Arguments</hi> why we cannot give our consent to this tenet.</p>
               </argument>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>THe meaning of rhe question will best be discovered by our inquiry of the nature of profession, what it implies, and how it is taken in this discourse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>PROFESSION</hi> in the most frequent and familiar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, signifies <hi>the publike manifestation of our assent to the doctrine of Faith, as in the word delivered and received by us, and our resolution to persist in the maintainance of the same.</hi> And then it is commonly used in a way of distinction from <hi>PRACTICE.</hi> And thus we say many professe <hi>fair,</hi> but their <hi>practice answers not their profession.</hi> And in this sense I suppose <hi>he doth not,</hi> nor indeed can he take <hi>profession,</hi> as serving his purpose.</p>
                  <p>For an excommunicate, who is cast out of the Church for his sinfull carriage, may notwithstanding in his judgement avouch all the truths of Scriptures, and outwardly desire to enjoy all Gods ordinances, and yet this gives him no formality of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, because he may have all these and be cut off from mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Profession is yet larger,</hi> and includes also a <hi>sutable carriage in the life,</hi> so far as the profession which is made, is <hi>void of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous courses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As <hi>Profession</hi> must not be too narrow, so we must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to make it too broad, as to exact more then is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in truth unto it. Namely <hi>Such a profession of the faith and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111062:49"/> assent to the doctrine of truth, is not here exacted, as that a person should not be counted to hold forth a profession of the faith, that</hi> (happily through ignorance and mistake) <hi>shall hold something differing from the truth, and from the apprehensions of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both persons or Churches which professe the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As suppose a Christian maintain <hi>Justification</hi> by Christs <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssive obedience only; Reprobation</hi> in massa corrupta; whether <hi>Children</hi> have <hi>habituall</hi> or <hi>actuall faith also.</hi> Such mistakes which may fall in some particulars, wherein pious and prudent men are of a different Judgement, do <hi>not make</hi> a person to be such a one, <hi>as doth not professe the faith savingly,</hi> so as may make way for <hi>membership in a visible Church</hi> warrantably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Profession</hi> conceived according to the compasse of the former explication, <hi>doth make (i.</hi> add a causall power <hi>with baptisme</hi> to) <hi>a member</hi> of the visible Church, and so a member of <hi>all</hi> the visible congregation on earth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>expressions</hi> of M. <hi>R.</hi> which lead me <hi>thus to conceive his meaning</hi> are <hi>diverse</hi> in divers passages of his books, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. c. 9. p. 116.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence then we have two things to discusse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That this profession makes not a member.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Being made and standing in his professed Covenant with God, or is not a member of every particular Congregation on earth.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That which opposeth and hinders the work of Baptisme,</hi> and so hinders the constitution or <hi>formality of membership:</hi> that <hi>doth not help it forwards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because this is made the most especiall ingredient in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of that relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But Profession lawfull and warrantable may do so.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For suppose a man professe the whole truth of God, only he differs or mistakes in this, that <hi>all the Churches on earth are ill gathered,</hi> and therefore he dares not, and so <hi>refuseth to be baptized.</hi> This profession is a warrantable profession (as it hath formerly been explicated in the third conclusion) and yet this hinders the work and dispensation of baptisme in the sense their specified: and therefore hinders, and helps not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of membership.</p>

                     <p>But the power of the Church in vertue of his consociation in that he falsified it, cast him out, and therefore must also receive him in upon his humiliation and <hi>subjection</hi> to the covenant again.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if possession and baptisme were sufficient to do the deed, baptisme remaining the same, as before his excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and now his profession being renewed, there is the whole <hi>formality</hi> of membership, which <hi>experience evidenceth to be false.</hi>

                     <p>Beside if he be a particular member, he must be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the compasse of members, But all the members of the Church catholike (take it as an <hi>integrum</hi>) are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within particular Congregations, therefore he must be a member of some of them, or else he comes not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe or number of members.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to be a member to the Catholike Church firstly, that is to be a member to an whole, <hi>which</hi> a man <hi>nor did, nor could see,</hi> nor do any homage to, nor receive any direction or influence of government from, This, I say, is such a sublimated imagination, that I must confesse, it is beyond my shallownesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.

                     <p>That which is said afterwards, That a member is cast out of the Catholike Church <hi>antecedenter,</hi> will prove an apparent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogisme, and we shall try the truth and strength of it, when we come unto that place.</p>
                     <p>The Proposition then hath free passe.</p>

                     <p>That which equally and indifferently belongs to all, that can make no particular appropriation to any one, why rather to this, then any other.</p>
                     <p>But this profession is equall and indifferent to all, as well as to any one, Therefore It can give no appropriation to any particular. <hi>No more,</hi> then if a woman <hi>love all</hi> Christian men, with Christian <hi>

                     <p>This tenet I cannot see how it can stand with the principles <hi>of truth,</hi> or with M. <hi>R.</hi> his <hi>own grounds.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Look <hi>what liberty or power a man hath in one particular Congregation, as a member, he hath the same in all.</hi> because he is a member every where.</p>
                     <p>If so, then he hath as much in <hi>choosing all</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations and in maintaining of them.</p>
                     <p>Then he cannot be <hi>cast out of one</hi> Congregation, unlesse all the Officers of all others do cast him out.</p>

                     <p>For if one professour be a member of every particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, then by a parity of reason, All particular professours must be so: and so all of them members of one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and so of every one.</p>
                     <p>Hence, there being the <hi>same</hi> members of <hi>every</hi> particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>every particular Congregation is the same,</hi> and thence it will follow that <hi>Ephesus</hi> is <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> to be <hi>Thyatira.</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111062:54"/> then this Church covenant, may be truly said to be <hi>included in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be taken in the <hi>narrowest acceptation</hi> [Beleeve and live] Then <hi>it</hi> is <hi>not the Covenant of the Gospel.</hi> For that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and <hi>invisible</hi> in its own nature, betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>soul</hi> only: But <hi>this</hi> is <hi>visible</hi> betwixt those who do professe the Faith.

So that in case the Churches are dissolved, and through persecution scattered, they are not then bound to the duties of this confederacy.</p>
               <p>It is then <hi>an ordinance of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And this also is here considerable, that we may discern things that differ: The making of the confederation belongs to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but <hi>being made,</hi> it hath also a confirmation from the <hi>law.</hi> As the appointing of <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Eucharist,</hi> belongs to the Gospel, are ordinances thereof, but being instituted, they stand by vertue of the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> and must be observed by vertue thereof. A man may be within the covenant of the morall law, and yet not be bound to the duties of a husband, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he make a particular covenant with such a woman to be her husband.</p>
               <p>And hence there is a broad difference betwixt duties and duties as the difference is large in the respects upon which they do arise. Many duties flow from the generall and necessary duties of morality, which reach a man as a <hi>creature,</hi> with reference to <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Creatour,</hi> or else to his <hi>fellow-creatures.</hi> And hence <hi>this</hi> relation from a rule <hi>of nature,</hi> it hath nothing to do with a <hi>free covenant,</hi> that must come between the persons and their duties. But in that they are creatures they must do homage to their creatour, and duty to their fellow-<hi>creatures.:</hi> If a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour preserve their honours, lives, goods, good names, yea be mercifull to their beasts, because such a creature, But there must <hi>intervene a new covenant</hi> betwixt parties and parties by mutuall and free consent, before they either should or can take up <hi>another sort of duties,</hi> People must by mutuall consent grow up into ingagement one with another into a corporation, before they should do the duties of a corporation. A <hi>servant</hi> must cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111062:54"/> with his Master, before he need or ought to serve him as a Master.</p>
               <p>And here these two things are apparently distinct. To <hi>Swear</hi> to do <hi>the duties</hi> of a servant, when he is one, doth <hi>not make</hi> him a servant. But to <hi>ingage</hi> himself and <hi>enter into covenant,</hi> that doth make him to be a servant. The like to this, we may say touching the choosing of <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> these are <hi>ordinances of the Gospel,</hi> and there is a peculiar covenant betwixt those that choose, and those that are chosen, which is <hi>not the covenant of the Gospel</hi> in precise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>The substance of this was in the time of the Law, and that covenanting among them issued, as it seems, from the Gospel, They were a called and select people unto God, <hi>Amos.</hi> 3, <hi>You only have I known, of all the nations of all the nations of the world,</hi> and therfore received into visible covenant, to walk in the waies of God, and the truth of his worship: and God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself, that he would blesse those priviledges, and the use of them, to their good, and the good of their <hi>children, reserving secret things to himself.</hi>

                     <q>That way members are to be inchurched, and enter into Church-fellowship, which way members were entered into the Apost. Churches. But members were not entered into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Church, by such a covenant but only they believed, professed belief, and were baptized. When the incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is reentred, It is said only <hi>2 Cor. 2.</hi> that he was grieved and testified it, and they did forgive him, and confirm their love to him. <hi>ver. 7.8.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>There is here no Church covenant. <hi>Act. 8.12. Samaria</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word gladly, beleeved, and was baptized. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptized. <hi>Act. 8. Cornelius</hi> and his houshold. <hi>Act. 10.</hi> The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> planted. <hi>Act. 14.</hi> Of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Act. <hi>18.</hi> Of <hi>Berea. 17.10. Philippi.</hi> Act. <hi>16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The proofs here alledged as precedentiall, are of three sorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Touching the receiving of the <hi>Incestuous Corinthian</hi> after his repentance. But that doth not overthrow the <hi>covenant,</hi> but confirm it, For their forgiving and confirming their love again to him, was crosse to his excommunication, and therefore an <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of the person into that <hi>corporation</hi> and communion which formerly he did enjoy, his subjecting himself in so solemn a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the rule of Christ in the Congregation and Church, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111062:56"/> craving acceptance at their hands, and entertainment into the like priviledges of communion, of which he was deprived by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his sin, and their ready receiving and entertaining of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that relation and state, and <hi>confirming their love to him</hi> in that behalf, is a <hi>full ingagement</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to him, and of <hi>him</hi> again to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas had his <hi>profession</hi> at large made him a member, he had been a <hi>member</hi> whether the Church would have received him or no: or if his <hi>baptisme</hi> had made him a member, as long as his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme had remained, his membership had continued, for whiles the <hi>forma</hi> remains, the <hi>formatum</hi> must needs be also. This exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will appear most pregnant, if we do but parallel it with the like in a civil corporation. A person, a member of the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in combination with them, through his ill carriage is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchised</hi> and put out of his place and priviledge; if he shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that sorrow and reformation, that sutes the quality of his sin, and give satisfaction to the Company, his subjecting himself to the Company, and power of the combination, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and entertaining of him upon such terms, is an expresse <hi>recovery</hi> and <hi>renewall of the Covenant</hi> again, and by that an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the party in the same condition and relation in which he was.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>rest of the proofs</hi> carry no concluding force with them. For if there be any force in the Argument, it must lie here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If no Church-covenant be there expressed, then there was none. The feeblenesse of which <hi>consequence</hi> appears at first sight. For to reason from <hi>one</hi> or <hi>some</hi> places against the expression in <hi>any place,</hi> is to conclude from an imperfect enumeration of some <hi>species,</hi> to deny the <hi>genus,</hi> which is a fallacy. It was not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Evangelists,</hi> therefore, <hi>in none.</hi> It is not said in <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> of the Prophets, therefore in none of them. We know it was the rule which the Apostle prescribed before ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> Act. 2.38. So the <hi>Baptist</hi> trained up his disciples. To reason therefore this profession of repentance is not mentioned in these places, therefore either was not here done, or that it is not in other places required, carries no force of reason with it.</p>
                  <p>That lastly of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <q>As many as received the word gladly, were baptised, and there were added three thousand. But these were not gathered as you gather.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:111062:56"/>
                  <p>M. <hi>R.</hi> takes this place as wronged by us, and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to deliver it out of our hands: 1. <q>Because these did not first meet frequently for praier and speciall conference, untill they were satisfied touching the good estate one of another. <hi>2.</hi> They could not set apart and celebrate a day of fasting and prayer, and dispatch the confessions of thirty hundred within such a time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If we cast an eye to the fore-going conclusions, it will appear that <hi>such fasting</hi> and praier is only required at the erecting <hi>and laying the foundation</hi> of a Church, and so also <hi>such</hi> frequent meeting, before they enter into so solemn engagement, and the <hi>setting up</hi> a holy Church unto Christ. But these solemnities are not expected in the <hi>taking in</hi> of severall members, nay the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the ordinary members to the body. Besides, these were members of the Jewish Church before. The stroke that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their spirits by the Ministery of the Apostles (for I doe not thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> only preached) was so extraordinary, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried such an apparent discovery of the presence and power of Christ, that without any miraculous power of discerning, their expressions might make way for members of the Jewish Church no finde acceptance with this Apostolike, and Christian Church now beginning.</p>
                  <p>Its added by the <hi>APOLOGY of the Church-covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they professed their glad receiving of the word, and renouncing that froward generation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being baptised they continued in fellowship, that was Church fellowship, for it was not the exercise of the Sacrament, which the <hi>Syriack</hi> conceives.</p>
                  <p>To this M. <hi>R.</hi> answers, <q>They could not continue in the Apostles fellowship and doctrine before they were added to the Church: for stedfastnesse in doctrine, and saving themselves from the froward generation, could not be but habituall holinesse, not perfected in six hours. Now the same day, <hi>vers. 41.</hi> in which they gladly heard the word, they were both baptised and added; and therefore their stedfast continuing in Church estate, can no waies make them members in Church state.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> True; nor is the Argument urged in that manner, but the dispute lies from the <hi>effect</hi> to the <hi>cause</hi> in that particular of it: In that they gave constant attendance to the ordinances of Christ, and in that fellowship, as taking themselves bound thereto, it argues they took themselves ingaged thereunto by that subjection
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111062:57"/> they did expresse in renouncing their former society, and desiring and receiving acceptance from the Apostles and the Church, so as such carriages carry the reality of a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is said, <q>If they had returned to Pontus again, they had returned added to the Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is easily <hi>replied.</hi> Had they returned with a purpose not to have walked in that fellowship, it is sure, they had not been of that Church by their baptisme: for <hi>ALL Jerusalem</hi> then, and <hi>Iudaa,</hi> and the coast about <hi>Iordan</hi> had been members of the Church by the baptisme of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obj. 3. <q>But here is no word of a Church-covenant, which was necessary to have been intimated, if there had been any such thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If it be not mentioned, therefore it was not, <hi>non sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> 1. If the <hi>thing</hi> be there, we need not trouble our selves for the <hi>word.</hi> And if <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement may be taken, who expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>[Libenter amplexos eorum sermonem,]</hi> he thus writes, <hi>Adjunctos Christi discipulis fuisse, vel in idem corpus insitos &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severasse in doctrina.</hi> And I shall offer to M. <hi>R.</hi> his consideration, That when there is a solemn baptising into a Church, <hi>that</hi> ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that the person is made a disciple of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. For upon that ground their commission warrants the administration of baptisme: and so to be a disciple of Christ, is to be ingraffed into the body of the Church, and to be as the Apostle hath it, <hi>Fellow-heirs, and of the same body,</hi> Ephes. 3.6. which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the visible Church: And therefore though many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.40. Yet they would not confesse him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his disciples, because they <hi>feared they should be cast out of the Synagogue.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>this</hi> embracing the word, this <hi>being made a disciple,</hi> its expressed by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>added</hi> to or <hi>incorporated,</hi> as in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. &amp; 5.14.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>all the people</hi> were then said to <hi>magnifie them,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to approve of their doctrine, and so confesse the truth and goodnesse of it; yet there was more required to this <hi>Church-work,</hi> and to become a disciple. And therefore its added, <hi>The beleevers were added,</hi> i. e. they confessed their sins, and became disciples and followers of that doctrine, and so ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and <hi>covenanted also for their children,</hi> to follow that truth of the Gospel. And if this being a disciple include not thus much, how can our Divines use this, as so strong a testimony against the Anabaptists, to make good the inference? If the converted
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111062:57"/> father was baptized: Therefore their children also, unles they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> themselves in <hi>Church-covenant</hi> for their children also?</p>
                  <p>Follow this order of the Apostle, Let them be members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Let them expresse the <hi>work of repentance</hi> with <hi>that power</hi> upon their souls, as these did, and <hi>receive the word with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> Our principles formerly propounded, will make way for their admittance.</p>
                  <p>The place thus expounded, finds much liberty and content to be in our hands, and will not be delivered, by all the reasons alledged by M. <hi>R.</hi> to go away from us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>If baptisme be the seal of our entry into the Church, <hi>1 Cor. 12.13.</hi> as circumcision was the seal of the members of the Iews visible Church: then such a Covenant is not the formal reason of our Church-membership. But the former <hi>is true, as I shall prove hereafter:</hi> Ergo, so is the later.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The proposition stands, because all baptised are members of the visible Church before they can swear this Covenant, even when they are infants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Proposition fails, nay fights against it self. For if it seal up our membership, and Covenant with the visible Church, then is it after-membership, and therefore not the formall cause of it, for then it should be before it.</p>
                  <p>Again, If it seal up our membership, as <hi>circumcision</hi> sealed up membership in the Jewish visible Church, then certainly it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the Covenant, for so that did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 13. <hi>He that is born shall be circumcised:</hi> so that he was in <hi>Covenant,</hi> and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>holy seed,</hi> before in his own person he could make a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> but was included in <hi>the Covenant of his parent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if M. <hi>R.</hi> be of another minde, we desire he would tell us, How children of believers are said to be <hi>holy,</hi> if not by a <hi>foederall</hi> holines? and if so, then by the <hi>visible</hi> Covenant of their Parents. <hi>For many children are SO holy that have parents not spiritually and invisibly within that Covenant. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, The proof is also false, namely, children are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers before they are in this Covenant, because though they doe <hi>not</hi> covenant <hi>personally</hi> by themselves, yet they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded virtually</hi> in the Covenant of their parents, <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> 29.10, 11.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>The Church-covenant either is all one with the Covenant of Grace, or it is a Covenant diverse from the Covenant of Grace. But neither waies can it be the essentiall form of a visible Church: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Covenant of Grace cannot be the forme of a visible Churcb, because then all baptised should be in Covenant with God, which our brethren deny. If it be a Covenant diverse from it, it must be of another nature, and lay another obligatory tie, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Covenant of works, or the Covenant of Grace: and so must tie to other duties, then either the law or Gospel require of us, and so is beside that Gospel which Paul taught, and makes the teacher, though an Angel from heaven, accursed. <hi>lib. 2. pa. 93.</hi> Bona verba.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. <hi>The Covenant of Grace</hi> is to be considered, either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>benefits</hi> of saving grace <hi>given</hi> in it, or according to the <hi>means</hi> of grace <hi>offered.</hi> It is not the Covenant of the Gospel in the first sense; but it is within the verge, and contained within the compasse of the Covenant in the second sense. And hence the consequence upon which the stresse of the cause (as it is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him) lies, vanisheth wholly. If it be distinct from the Covenant of grace, then it doth oblige us to some other duties, then the Ordinances of the Gospel require. For it hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, That a man may be in the Covenant of grace, and share in the benefit thereof, who is not in a Church state; and a man may be in a Church state, who is not really in the Covenant of grace: And therefore a Church state, and the Covenant of the Gospel, in the former sense expressed, are different. Yea it hath been proved, That all are bound to come within the Covenant of the Gospel, who are not at that time bound to come into the Church estate, nor yet to doe the duties thereof.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>R.</hi> when he is to answer to this difference, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 93. <hi>∆≤bi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr√†,</hi> he grants, That an excommunicate person may be in the Covenant of grace, and yet cut off from the visible Church: and yet denies the consequence, but gives no reason of that denial, but only speaks of another thing, which toucheth not the pinch of the Question in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>A beleever <hi>(saies he)</hi> in the Covenant of grace, may not doe a duty to a father, brother, or master, and yet it is a weak consequence,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111062:58"/> that there is a covenant or oath betwixt these, brother and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Father, Master and Servant, commanded by a divine law of perpetuall equity to make such to be in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We confesse this is a weak consequence, and is of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therefore may as easily be confuted as it is propounded, but <hi>this is our consequence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man may be within the covenant of grace, and not within the covenant of the Church, and therefore the one is not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if two things be the same in themselves, so far they be the same in the third, and where the one is, the other will be. So that the Answer stands in the full vigour wholly untouched, only he speaks of other things, <hi>some</hi> not touching the cause in hand, <hi>some</hi> that will not stand by a rule of truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Those expressions touch not the cause in hand,</hi> namely when he thus writes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The covenant of grace teacheth us to confesse Christ, to walk before God, to joyn my self to a visible Church. But none can conclude in right reason, that it is a divine law, that necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates me to swear another covenant, then the covenant of grace in relation to these duties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Its true, no law bindes to enter into another covenant, then the covenant of the Gospel: because these duties result out of relations, which arise from the nature of the creature in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, but come not within <hi>the free</hi> and <hi>voluntary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> which is made by the voluntary consent of the parties. But take the same expressions as looking at a covenant which issues from the willing consent betwixt man and man, as master and servant, man and wife, and it will be evident at the very first sight, that it is false.</p>
                  <p>For to say there is no divine law to necessitate a man to enter into another covenant for marriage, beside the covenant of grace, before he can do the duty of an husband, is to go against the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ages, the common sense of all men. As though a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might adventure to take the place and do the duties of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to a woman, who never made a covenant of marriage, and tell her he hath been in the covenant of grace many years, and there needs no other, there is no law necessitates him or her to make a marriage covenant together, I suppose a person might suspect the man had not only lost his honesty, but his pru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ence also.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:111062:59"/>
                  <p>Should some <hi>Nimrod</hi> of the world come upon a poor solitary people, and tell them that the covenant of grace and the Gospel, teacheth the people to pay tribute to their Prince, and the Prince to exact it. They both professe this Gospel: There is no divine law to binde them to make another covenant of King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and therefore now they must pay, and he must exact tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute at their hand. I suppose the poor people, out of their own sense will tell him, that there is indeed a covenant required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man to make men Christians. But there must be another covenant betwixt Prince and people, to make them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Ruled: other wise he could expect no homage from them, nor they protection from him.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Authour <hi>of the Apology</hi> suggesting to M. <hi>R.</hi> that it is not the word only that giveth power to the husband over his wife, but the covenanting of the wife with the husband. He answers, <hi>"This is all which with colour of reason can be said,</hi> and therefore labours to decline the dint of the dispute, because it carried such a troop of inconveniences with it, affirms <q>that those places of Scripture were not brought to prove the Pastors calling to the people, or their relative case of subjection to him: but only they proue that the covenant of grace and the Gospel layeth a tye of many duties upon us, which obligeth us without the comming under the tie of an expresse, vocall, publike oath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I wonder who ever denied this: let the man be brought forth, and bear his blame and shame, that should be so void of sense, only let it be here also remembred, that also this is wrested by strong hand, and confessed, <hi>that there be in some conditions a Covenant that comes between persons, as betwixt man and wife, Master and servant, before they can come under these relations,</hi> which was denied in the 93. pa. immediatly preceeding. Such is the brightnesse of the truth that it cannot be overborn.</p>
                  <p>That which is next added, is partly a craving the question, and the proof is yet insufficient to make it good, <q>Because I professe the Faith, and am baptized. I am a member of the visible Church, without such an oath: Because the covenant of grace, doth tye me to joyn my self to some particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply is.</p>
                  <p>That of Baptisme is answered. 2. The ground of that which is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111062:59"/> added is a mistake, to wit, If the Covenant of the Gospel tye me to joyn my self to a visible Congregation, Therefore there is not a covenant required to do that.</p>
                  <p>If this be a good consequence, take the like, If the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to seek for the help of a godly Pastour, that may rule and teach me. If it require me <hi>to marry</hi> and not to burn. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no <hi>Covenant</hi> required to make me a husband to a woman, that I must marry; nor a sheep of that Shepheard who must guide and rule me in the Lord. If these be false, then the former is as feeble and weak, for they both carry the same parity and proportion of reason.</p>
                  <p>Some expressions which here fall from the pen of M.<hi>R.</hi> are to my apprehensions, new Paradoxes. As, <q>A called Pastor who hath gifts, and a calling from the Church, is a member of the visible Church, before he be called to be their Pastor, though he be a member of no particular Congregation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difficulties are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a Pastor may have a <hi>calling</hi> from the Church, before he is <hi>elected</hi> by a particular Congregation, and so be an <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum vagum,</hi> a <hi>Pastor of all people,</hi> and yet of <hi>no particular</hi> people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a person may be a member of the visible Church, and yet be no member of it, and that I will infer from his own words, Thus,</p>
                  <p>He that <hi>is no member of a particular Congregation, he is no member of a visible Church. But a Pastor may be a member of a visible Church, and yet no member of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Therefore he may be a member of the visible Church, and yet no member</hi> The second part M.<hi>R.</hi> affirms. I prove the proposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If all particular</hi> Congregations are all the members that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church hath, <hi>Then</hi> he that is not a member of a particular Congregation is no member of a visible Church: for that which comes not within the numqer and compasse of members is not a member.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> all particular Congregations are all the members that the visible Church hath, <hi>Therefore</hi> he that is not a member of a particular Congregation is no member of a visible Church.</p>
                  <p>But of these, thus much by the way occasionally we shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat more fully of them, when we come to the place of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:111062:60"/> calling of Ministers.</p>
                  <p>In the end of the 95. <hi>pag. lib.</hi> He plainly professeth, That when one doth enter a member to such a Congregation, under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of <hi>A. B.</hi> he cometh under a new relative estate by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and vertuall Covenant, which is crosse to what was affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, <hi>p.</hi> 92. The rest of the examples either confute his own assertion, or else do not reach the Question in hand. For we have shewed before, that excommunicates when they come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, they renew the Covenant with the Church, and the Church with them.</p>
                  <p>That which is added, <q>touching a Church newly erected, she then becomes a sister-church with others, yet she needs not a new Covenant to accomplish it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No certainly, the reason is from the third conclusion, <hi>supra.</hi> Our Covenant once entered upon, all the relations, that depend upon <hi>that,</hi> or may be inferred from <hi>that,</hi> are included in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore needs no more. As a woman being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with her husband, all the duties to <hi>his kindred</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by that, and flow from that Covenant, there needs no other.</p>
                  <p>Especially that inference is a wide mistake. <q>If I must have a new Covenant to bring me into an estate, which issues only from free and voluntary consent; Then I must not honour men in several relations, as Physitians, Lawyers, learned Philosophers, unlesse I take up a particular Covenant.</q> I say, such a consequence hath no shadow of reason in it, nor the least appearance of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the cause, because the honour we owe to each man, as a neighbour, in his place and condition, is founded in a <hi>naturall</hi> relation we have, as fellow-fervants to the great God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of all man-kinde. And therefore we must love God, and all things of God, in our neighbour, which concerns us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must preserve the honour, life, goods, good name, of all, whether Lawyers, or Philosophers, or Physitians. Let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence.</p>
                  <p>That I should therefore doe the duty of a servant to him that is not my master: of a husband to her that is not my wife, is a very weak inference, and carries no proportion of reason withit.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 97.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Though there be a tacit Covenant betwixt a new member of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and A. B. Pastor, and they come under a new relation,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111062:60"/> Covenant-wise <hi>(which I grant)</hi> this is not the point in question. But this new Covenant is that which by necessity of a divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, of perpetuall equity maketh the new adjoyner a member.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We are now then at the last, almost come to our selves, for we are come to this, That there must be a new relation Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wise betwixt parties in estates and conditions, which issue from free consent betwixt them, before they can be tied to the duties of that estate, by being in the Covenant of the Gospel, the contrary whereof was affirmed, <hi>p.</hi> 93. <hi>juxta finem,</hi> and 94. lin. 1. to the ninth.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore that which the <hi>Apology</hi> expressed, to wit, <q>That its not the rules of the Word touching man and wife, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and subject, that makes people in such an estate, but the Covenant that is made betwixt them to those ends.</q> I say, this was by him to be answered, <hi>pag.</hi> 94. but yet stands in its full force, and not weakned, nay not touched, nay in truth confirmed by this grant.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, That is made the great hinge of our debate, that I thinke never came into our thoughts, neither waking, nor sleeping, namely, <q>That this new Covenant betwixt a person, and A. B. Pastor, did make such the new Adjoiner, a member of a new Congregation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, I would fain have one of ours produced, that either in writing or printing ever said any such thing, or any thing that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a shadow of any such conceit; when its well known to all, that know our principles and practice, we professe the Church is a true Church, as <hi>Totum essentiale,</hi> before her officers, and the choice of them. The particular persons are members before this choice, and therefore are not made such by this choice or new Covenant.</p>

But let us hear the <hi>waies</hi> that are so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <q>It is a dream, that all are converted by the means of private Christians, without the ministery of sent Pastors. l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>120.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I confesse it is a dream to say so, or think so. And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do dream of such a device in the night, let him own it, and defend it in the day, we own it not. Is it likely that any man is so forsaken of reason, as to say, that the Apostles when they came to plant Churches, that private Christians, not they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the people? And if they converted all those first Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where is the man that will affirm, that <hi>All [All,]</hi> are converted by private Christians? Though its possible that private Christians may convert some, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.19. Beside, materials of new gathered Churches with us, are such, as have been converted by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in their severall Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>Its an unwarrantable way, to say that Pastors, as Pastors, are not sent to Indians.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is warrant enough to affirm that, and evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prove it; As shall appear in the handling of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and power of a Pastor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Absurdity. <q>That men must be satisfied in their consciences, touching one anothers conversion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:111062:61"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That the members of Churches should be visible Saints, and that to reasonable charity, we have formerly proved: and that such should <hi>so professe, as that the soundnesse and truth of their faith may be notified to the Church,</hi> is granted by M. <hi>R.</hi> and this is as much as we desire, and so we doubt not, but <hi>Ananias, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c. did appear such to the judgement of charity, which alwaies judgeth the best, unlesse it can prove the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Unwarrantable way. <q>By what warrant of the word are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians, not in office, made the ordinary and only converters of souls?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no word that warrants it; and I know none of us that affirm it, that all are converted by private Christians. The sound of such an absurity is so continually in the ear and minde of M. <hi>R,</hi> (but from whence it comes, I know not) that I see it findes such welcome, that he is willing to repeat it twice, rather then to misse the remembrance and mentioning of it, and therefore he repeats it as a double absurdity, this fourth being the same with the first, and by this way he may fill the number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable waies easily.</p>
                  <p>If by <hi>ordinary,</hi> he understand that which is <hi>frequent</hi> in a course of common providence, which is neither <hi>miraculum,</hi> nor yet <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum,</hi> for the extraordinarinesse thereof, I suppose each mans <hi>experience</hi> will evidence this truth, <hi>That the endeavour of persons out of office, hath been blessed, and is blessed to the conversion of divers,</hi> and that without prejudice to the office and ordinance of Christ. But were all this granted to be unwarrantable, what is such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to overthrow the Covenant? That may be yet a truth, though such apprehensions may be false, but the Proverb is true, <hi>He that counts a man his enemy, he is content to go much out of his way, that he may lend him a blow:</hi> If there may be any blemish cast upon the Covenant, it skils not from what coast it comes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <q>What warrant have the sister-churches to give the right-hand of fellowship to a new erected Church? For to give the right-hand of fellowship is an Authoritative and Pastorall act, as <hi>Galat. 2.</hi> When <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> perceived the grace that was given me, they gave unto me and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the right-hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Suppose the sister-churches had no warrant to give the right-hand of fellowship, yet the <hi>Covenant</hi> for all that may be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111062:62"/> warrantable. And yet the quarrel must hence be maintained against the innocent Covenant. <hi>As the lion quarrelled with the lamb for mudding the water, when she dranke many miles below his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us see the hainous <hi>unwarrantablenesse</hi> of this course of giving the <hi>right-hand of fellowship</hi> to sister-churches. <hi>The first</hi> cause is, <hi>because it is an Authoritative act,</hi> as <hi>Pareus, Beza.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Authours give in no evidence this way. For the words of <hi>Pareus</hi> in the margin, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 161. shew the contrary. It is made <hi>Intimae conjunctionis symbolum,</hi> but not <hi>authoritatis. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate love,</hi> friendship and familiarity doth not inferre <hi>authority.</hi> But <hi>Beza</hi> his words put it beyond question, <hi>Porrexerunt manum, quod symbolum esset nostrae in Evangelij doctrin√¢ summae consensionis.</hi> Why M.<hi>R.</hi> should construe, <hi>symbolum consensionis</hi> to be <hi>symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum authoritatis,</hi> is beyond my understanding. But if Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters help not, <hi>yet his Argument</hi> it may be will settle the cause, therefore he repeats this again, and adds this reason. <q>By no authority can they receive them as members of the Catholike Church, for this receiving is a Church act, and they have no Church power.</q> The frame stands thus,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Proposition is apparently weak. The <hi>Church</hi> can put forth an act of <hi>counsel,</hi> of approbation, of love, of conjunction, as well as an act of <hi>power.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>One Church, or many Congregations, may meet with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, may teach them occasionally, convince them, encourage them, and yet have no power over them.

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here our brethren acknowledge, that there is a Church in the N. T. made up of many congregations, which hath power to receive in whole Churches. This is a Visible, Provincial or National Church, which they otherwise deny.

Here is a <hi>Church-meeting:</hi> A <hi>Classis</hi> it cannot be, because they are two only Congregations of the Classis: and Provincial it is not, nor yet National: Therefore there is now a new Church made up of many Churches, which is neither <hi>Classical</hi> nor <hi>Provincial.</hi> When will there be an end of such inferences?</p>

               <p>Touching this <hi>Congregationall Church,</hi> if we look at the Order and <hi>Precedency</hi> of it, we have two Questions that offer themselves to our consideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether a company of beleevers,</hi> thus visibly consociating themselves, are truly called, and are in truth, and indeed, a <hi>Church,</hi> in the phrase of Scripture, <hi>before they have Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The trumpet here gives an uncertain sound: and therefore we cannot tell well where to fasten, M. <hi>R.</hi> his expressions are so full of variety. Sometimes he seems to speak the same with us: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be of a differing minde. One while he laies the weight
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111062:64"/> upon a ministeriall Church, as including officers therein. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while he seems not only to deny the Church, thus consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be <hi>Totum organicum,</hi> but to deny the Church to be a Church, without Officers.</p>
               <p>To avoid therefore all offensive mistakes, we shall in short set down, <hi>what we conceive</hi> to be the truth in this case: and so we shall occasion M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>R.</hi> more fully to explicate his minde.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>Ministerial,</hi> that word may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in a <hi>double consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Generally,</hi> as implying <hi>any delegated power,</hi> in the exercise of any <hi>Church-acts</hi> in way of subordination under Christ, and by power and appointment from him. Thus a number of believers or visible Saints now consociated, hath power of <hi>admission</hi> of new members, and <hi>election</hi> of Officers, according to the order of Christ, and in case the officer chosen shall prove hereticall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately wicked, they have power to reject him, and make him no officer unto them.</p>
               <p>All these are granted by M.<hi>R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these are <hi>acts of Church-discipline largely</hi> taken, and acts of power. For to <hi>give a key of power,</hi> and to take away a key of power, argues power in so doing, according to the institution of Christ.</p>
               <p>How far the Church may upon just grounds, and for just cause proceed to excommunicate, we shall afterwards enquire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ministerial is taken more <hi>strictly,</hi> as it seems M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                  <hi>R.</hi> would by his expressions make us conceive: then it implies an <hi>Office-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or <hi>power of Officers,</hi> and so it cals for Ministers, <hi>i. e.</hi> Officers. And in this sense it should be without sense to affirm, That the Church should be <hi>Totum organicum, without organs:</hi> That the Church should consist of <hi>Ruling officers,</hi> and <hi>Ruled-people,</hi> when it is without all officers.</p>
               <p>These things being premised, our apprehensions are thus laid down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of Visible Saints confederating together to walk in the fellowship of the Faith, as thus, it is <hi>Totum essentiale,</hi> It is <hi>before</hi> all Officers.</hi>

                  <head>Argument 1.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God hath set Officers in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the Church is before the Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the setting of the candle in the candlestick, presupposeth the candlestick. The Church is the candlestick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. The Officers are the candles.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>R.</hi> answers, <q>God hath put and breathed in man a living soul: Therefore he is a living man, before the soul was breathed in him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>"Friend, The logick is naught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> A friendly warning is good: but the <hi>Logick may be good</hi> also, for any thing that is here said. For, It is said, <hi>God made man of the earth, i. e.</hi> The body of man of the earth; and he breathed into the nostrils of that body, or into that body so made by that mean, <hi>the breath of life.</hi> And I suppose, to affirm, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was made before the soul was infused, that the <hi>body,</hi> which is the subject to receive the soul, must in nature be <hi>before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap> soul,</hi> is very <hi>good Logick.</hi> And thus the comparison holds betwixt the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>totum essentiale,</hi> and the <hi>Officers.</hi> But to take <hi>man</hi> in a proper sense, as an <hi>effect</hi> consisting of <hi>body and soul,</hi> and to say in propriety of speech, <hi>God breathed life into an effect that had life,</hi> God put a form into an effect that had a form, no law of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage will admit such an expression, much lesse the rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son bear it. For the form is put into the matter, and is there in nature before the effect exists. It neither is, nor can be said to be put into the effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Besides,</hi> Here is yet a further advantage to the cause in hand, in that the Church is not only the subject in which these Officers are, as <hi>totum essentiale:</hi> but by vertue of her choice, she is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of the Officers call: and therefore in reason must be before them.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>R.</hi> answers secondly, <q>The Church is the Candlestick, not simply without candles and lamps: the Church ministeriall is the Candlestick, and the Ministers the candles: and by the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles setting in the Church, the Church becomes a ministerial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> It's crosse to all mens apprehensions and expressions, that the <hi>Candlestick</hi> should be no <hi>longer</hi> a Candlestick, then the candle is in it; why doe work-men sell them for Candlesticks, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:111062:65"/> men count them so, buy them for such, before they put any candles in them? Is not a <hi>subject</hi> truly <hi>affectum ad arguendum,</hi> affected to argue a <hi>separable adjunct,</hi> and so truly called a <hi>subject,</hi> though his <hi>adjunct</hi> be not <hi>there,</hi> and be actually disposed with him? What kinde of Logick this is, let the Reader, that hath any logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal judgement in him, judge.</p>
                  <p>As if one should say, It is <hi>not a Corporation</hi> of Aldermen, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>before the Maior</hi> be chosen. It is true, it is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>compleat corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of Maior and Freemen, unlesse there be both: but that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but they be a <hi>corporation of Free-men</hi> united amongst themselves, though there be no Maior. Nay, they <hi>must</hi> be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, <hi>before</hi> they can chuse a Maior: and therefore they must in reason and nature be before him. A man <hi>cannot</hi> be a <hi>husband,</hi> before he have a wife, yet he may and must be a <hi>man wooing</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, before he can make her a wife.</p>

               <div n="2" type="argument">
                  <head>Argument 2.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Church be not a Church without Officers, then as often as the Officers die, the Church dieth also.</hi> Nay, when the Church shall have just occasion (as such its possible may be) to reject her Officers for heresies, or grosse villanies, When they <hi>reject</hi> them, do they therefore <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>stroy the Church and themselves</hi> in so doing, when they labour to preserve themselves, nay use the means for their preservation?</p>
                  <p>Doth a Corporation, when it puts out a wicked Maior out of his place and priviledges, Doe they therefore destroy their own liberties, and nullifie their Corporation by that means, which is the especiall way and mean of their safety and comfort?</p>
                  <p>One would think that such Arguments were sufficient to cast a cause, carrying such sensible evidence with them, and yet M. <hi>R.</hi> strength can turn aside all.</p>
                  <p>He answers, <q>When the shepherds are removed, the tents cannot be called, the shepherds tents: and persecution doth often deface the visible face of a ministeriall Church: and to remove the Candlestick is to remove the Ministery; as to take away eyes, and ears, and hands from the body, is to hurt the integrity of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>All communion ministeriall, whereby we are a body visible, <hi>1 Cor. 10.16.</hi> eating one bread, may well be loosed, when Pastors are removed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:111062:65"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> When the shepherds are removed, the tents cannot be called, <hi>The tents where the shepherds are,</hi> yet they may be called, <hi>The tents fit to receive them,</hi> and in point of that fitnesse, they are the same they were before they were chosen, and remain the same.</p>
                  <p>Its true, to <hi>remove the Candlestick</hi> is to remove the Ministery: because the Ministery and Ministers have their <hi>dependance</hi> upon the Church. Destroy the man, the <hi>whole,</hi> you destroy the <hi>parts.</hi> But it holds not contrariwise. It is true, in a <hi>Ministeriall,</hi> i. e. an <hi>Organicum totum,</hi> when you take away any part, you lame the <hi>integrity</hi> of it; but you do not destroy the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of it, as <hi>totum essentiale. Socrates</hi> may loose a limb, an eye, an hand, and so he is <hi>not</hi> an <hi>entire man,</hi> consisting of such members, yet he hath <hi>totam naturam &amp; definitionem hominis,</hi> in regard of his <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall causes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is added, is yet more beside the cause; For its granted on all hands, That where <hi>Officers</hi> are not, there is no communion in the Sacraments. Is there therefore no Church communion? Such consequences come not within the compasse of the cause.</p>
                  <p>We have done now with the first Query, and made it clear,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That this Church is before all Officers, and may be without them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second QUESTION now comes into consideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether there be any Presbyterian Churches in the New Testament of Christs appointment and institution, or only Congregational?</hi>

                  <p>A Presbyterian Church results, and ariseth upon three main principles, which are as the <hi>pillars</hi> of its speciall <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There must be <hi>severall</hi> Congregations, made <hi>entire</hi> of such members, as Christ hath appointed, to make up an <hi>integrall body,</hi> of <hi>Officers</hi> which rule; and <hi>people,</hi> which are led and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>These Congregations neighbouring together,</hi> so that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may be accommodated with more ease, and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conveniency, and the scandals that may prejudice and taint by their infectious example, may be more easily cured and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:111062:66"/> And <hi>such a number</hi> of them should enter into <hi>combination</hi> each with other in the concurrence of <hi>common government,</hi> which may relieve the <hi>common good</hi> of all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>These so combined, are to send their Rulers,</hi> according to mutuall agreement, <hi>to manage the great censures of Christ,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the emergent doubts and difficulties that may arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the combined Congregations: and to such <hi>dispensations</hi> and determinations all the <hi>severall Churches</hi> combined are <hi>to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> as to <hi>acts of jurisdiction,</hi> proceeding from such, as are set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the Lord for that end.</p>

                     <hi>These Elders and Presbyters</hi> of these combined Churches, <hi>thus assembled,</hi> are called, <hi>A Presbyterian Church:</hi> because this <hi>Representative body</hi> is made up only of Presbyters and Elders.</q>
                  <p>And of this we are now to enquire, and to lay down such grounds, as may clear the enquiry and discovery of such a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: and these are as followeth.</p>

                     <p>And hence the <hi>School,</hi> when they will

                     <p>Only when they would gratify their great master the <hi>Pope,</hi> and do homage to the Church of Rome, they then devise a way to put out the right eye of their reason, and to crook the rule and crosse their own principles, that they may promote the primacy and plenitude of the power of the Pope.</p>

                     <p>But whatever they conceit, the evidence of the truth is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, that it will constrain the understanding to yeeld to that which is here required. For this Jurisdiction (in the sense I take it) in the <hi>exercise</hi> thereof, either requires one <hi>called</hi> or <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized</hi> by office: or else any without this authority may doe it. But none is a Steward unlesse set over the Family. <hi>Governments</hi> are not in the Church, unlesse they be appointed <hi>by Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.27.28. yea the blinde Pharisees could grope at this in the darknes of their delusions, as appears by the question they put
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:111062:67"/> unto our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.23</note>
                        <hi>BY WHAT A∆≤THORITY dost thou these things,</hi> and who gave thee this Authority? So that the putting of this <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> i. e. <hi>Authoritative or Office juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> (whereof we now speak) into the hands <hi>of any,</hi> who are <hi>not appointed</hi> to the <hi>Office</hi> of rule, is meerly the usurpation of that <hi>Man of sin,</hi> or a <hi>preparation</hi> to bring him in; or a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> of him, not fully cast out, not the native and naturall institution of our Saviour, the <hi>Lawgiver of his Church,</hi> and therefore you shall observe,</p>
                     <p>What ever may promote the plenitude of the Popes power, and bring the last resolution of all thither, It is so given to some of his creatures in eminent place, that in issue it may be confined within the compasse of his Triple-crown. Hence the Bishop, which is the Popes <hi>vice-gerent,</hi> he will dispense his power to his poor underlings by such <hi>pittances</hi> and allowances, that the poor Snakes may be trained up by their daily experience to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where the treasury of this power is stored up, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must go to fetch it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence</hi> First, He must be made a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and allowed <hi>to read,</hi> but not <hi>preach;</hi> to administer <hi>Baptisme,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Supper;</hi> not that one Sacrament is of greater eminency then the other: but that the servant must know, they have no power further then they have his allowance.</p>
                     <p>At the next turn he is made a Priest, and to that he hath fresh writings, and fresh Seal, and fresh ordination. And when that is attained, yet he cannot preach in any Assembly besides his own, but he must have a <hi>license</hi> and allowance for that. And <hi>all this ad placitum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore when all is granted, he must <hi>do none</hi> of these, <hi>if his</hi> Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> be <hi>present,</hi> and will officiate in his own person. So much power the Bishop hath over so many Parishes, that by this means his power being received from the Pope, the fulnesse may be derived from him, and returned to him again in a ready way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> (as I said) <hi>this is the Popes usurpation, not Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence</hi> the second ground I lay down, is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is no Office in the Church, but only such which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ; and therefore there is no Iurisdiction or rule can be exercised, but only by the officers of Christ.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The first part</hi> of the conclusion hath been cleared before.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Officers and Offices</hi> are <hi>Coronation mercies:</hi> gifts which proceed only from the <hi>Ascention</hi> of Christ. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 11, 12. <hi>When he ascended up on high, ‚ÄîHe gave gifts unto men, some tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, some Pastors,</hi> Its Christs prerogative royall to bestow such gifts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are <hi>proper means of his worship,</hi> and therefore it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to him to injoyn them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is in his hand <hi>only to blesse</hi> and succeed them in their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall dispensations, to the attainment of those supernaturall ends. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. and therefore it appertains to him alone to appoint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The inference</hi> of the <hi>second part</hi> of the Conclusion is clear, from what was formerly proved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All jurisdiction</hi> must issue from an Order or Officer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But there</hi> is none, but Officers of Christ allowed in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>no jurisdiction</hi> spirituall, ecclesiastick, can <hi>be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but by an Officer of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Surrogates, Chancellours, Arch-deacons, Deans, Officials,</hi> Vicars-general, Abbots, Monks, Friers, Cardinals, Jesuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are hatched and spawned, by the pride and luxury, ambition and tyranny of that Man of sin, as vermine and <hi>strange creatures</hi> out of the slime of <hi>Nilus;</hi> They are <hi>none of the Orders</hi> and Officers of Christ. And therefore have <hi>no authority</hi> by any right from him <hi>to exercise any jurisdiction in his Churches,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his people.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For it is <hi>in Christ</hi> alone, as to appoint the calling and Office; so <hi>to lay out the bounds and limits,</hi> to specifie the severall actions and operations thereof, therein required; and to exact the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof. Therefore <hi>they must attend to teaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> Rom. 12.7, 8. <hi>They must rule with diligence, take heed to themselves, and to the flock,</hi> Act. 20.28. They <hi>must binde up</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>recall</hi> the straying, <hi>tender</hi> the weak, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4.</p>
                     <p>True, by violence and cruelty they may be oppressed, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111062:68"/> imprisoned, and by strong hand hindered from doing their work, and then God cals for <hi>suffering, not doing;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Whether it be better to obey God or man,</hi> let any <hi>judge, Act.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> These two, <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> are not members or <hi>species</hi> of power, put in way of <hi>opposition</hi> one against the other, but are in <hi>subordination</hi> one to the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> There must be <hi>an Office before the Jurisdiction,</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> issuing there-from.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>Where,</hi> there is <hi>no office,</hi> there is <hi>no right of Rule</hi> or jurisdiction, as such, whereof we here speak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> They, who have the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>equall Offices,</hi> they have the <hi>same</hi> and <hi>equall Office-rule</hi> or jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> What ever is <hi>added, beside office,</hi> it adds <hi>no jurisdiction</hi> or rule ecclesiastick at all to any.</p>

Its obvious to each mans apprehensions, that every Elder and particular Governour in his Congregation, as he hath <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Elder</hi> in <hi>generall:</hi> so out of power he can, and doth put forth <hi>generall actions</hi> that are <hi>common to other Elders,</hi> and so also meet with those generall things which concern Government in generall.

                        </p>
                        <p>These relations of Grand-father and Father come from <hi>several</hi> grounds, from which the relative respects issue.

                        <p>
                           <q>The judicatures of Classis and Congregation doe not differ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or specifically, but only in more or lesse extension of power, <hi>lib. 2.</hi> p. <hi>338.</hi>

                        <p>From <hi>whence</hi> to my understanding, such <hi>collections</hi> seem fair and to follow undeniably.</p>
                        <p>If there be <hi>one office</hi> in the constitution, then there is the <hi>same definition of an office</hi> belonging to the Elder of a <hi>Classis</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:</hi> then the <hi>same causes,</hi> then the same <hi>election and choice.</hi> Then <hi>what</hi> he doth by vertue of his office <hi>to one,</hi> he is bound to do <hi>to the other.</hi> Then <hi>what operations</hi> he putteth forth in <hi>the one,</hi> he can put forth in <hi>the other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, If they differ but in extension, then <hi>vis intrinseca</hi> and intensive is <hi>the same</hi> in the <hi>Elders</hi> of a <hi>Congregation,</hi> as of a <hi>Classis.</hi> Therefore there is no <hi>specifical</hi> act, that the one puts forth, but the other can put forth, as occasion shall require.

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Reply</hi> is, The Elders did the one <hi>as Counsellours,</hi> they governed the other as <hi>Rulers,</hi> as we hope will appear in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                        <p>But that other, to wit, <hi>l.</hi> 2. 330.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>By that same official power, that a Pastor teacheth his own flock, <hi>viva voce,</hi> by vocal preaching as a Doctor, he teacheth other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by writing.</q>

                        <p>Clear then it is, He teacheth other Churches by writing.</p>
                        <p>But that this, thus teaching of Churches comes from the <hi>same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial power</hi> that he teacheth <hi>his own</hi> flock <hi>viv√¢ voce,</hi> is questioned upon these <hi>grounds.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>For, first, That <hi>officiall power</hi> by which he <hi>preacheth</hi> to his proper flock, he received <hi>by election</hi> from the people, stands bound to them, may be rejected by them in case of delinquency notorious.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By that official power, he <hi>can require</hi> all his to <hi>hear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In case they gain-say offensively, <hi>to censure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If his <hi>writing</hi> proceeds out of that power, then by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he could challenge and require them <hi>to reade it,</hi> and <hi>censure them for not reading.</hi> Nay, upon this ground he should not only have power over the Churches <hi>within the Presbytery</hi> or Classis, but <hi>over those,</hi> who are under other Classis, nay other <hi>Provinces, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c. Nay the case may be that he may have official power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>all the</hi> Churches in the world, for they all may be taught by his books and writing: <hi>yea,</hi> those that are <hi>infidels,</hi> and yet have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111062:73"/> but knowledge of the language, they may be taught by this, and why may he not be Pastor to perform acts from his office to them all?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It misseth that right ground of power:</hi> for <hi>if this</hi> power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>from his office,</hi> then it is some where required, that <hi>each</hi> man should as well <hi>print,</hi> as <hi>preach.</hi> For to preach <hi>viv√¢ voce</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of every Pastor, out of his office: but if printing issue from the same office, the one should as necessarily be required as the other: and hence, what he preacheth he must print: for he is bound to teach his people <hi>viv√¢ voce,</hi> by vertue of his office, and if his office cals for this, he is bound to this also, as well as to that: but that we finde writ in no Gospel that I know of.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>That which another may doe with as much authority and more;</hi> I mean authority of truth, as being more able, yet being out of office, That cannot belong to the power of an office.</p>

                           <hi>When it was asked,</hi> Whether are the Classical Elders, Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Teaching Elders to the classical Church?</p>
                        <p>M.<hi>R.</hi> answers <hi>p.</hi> 330. <q>They are both, and they are neither in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers considerations.

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Reply</hi> is,</p>
                        <p>When we enquire, <hi>What kinde of Elder a Classical Elder is,</hi> we are told, that they are Elders <hi>teaching</hi> in all Congregations <hi>distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively,</hi> i. e. take classical Elders, as they are Congregational Elders; and that is all one, as to say, <hi>No classical Elders, and then they are teaching Elders:</hi> for so far as they have reference to their proper flocks, they were teaching Elders before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, and so all that is gained, is this, <hi>A classical Elder, as he is no classical Elder, is a teaching Elder;</hi> and so there is not a <hi>distinction,</hi> or divers consideration of a classical Elder (which should have been the term distinguished) but a <hi>non-consideration</hi> of him, <hi>as such.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Further, It hath been often said, That these acts of the Elders, issue from one and the same office: now where there is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same office,</hi> there is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same officer,</hi>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:111062:74"/> and so the <hi>same power</hi> of teaching and ruling, and the <hi>same duty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, We have here that for granted, which before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That <hi>a person may have many flocks:</hi> he may be a <hi>teaching</hi> Pastor in one, and a <hi>Ruling</hi> in two or three, or thirty: for its affirmed, That a Ruling Pastor is also a Teaching Pastor, but not to that same flock alwaies. Therefore he may have many flocks. And so the Lord <hi>Bishop may be a teaching Pastor in the Cathedral at Canterbury, but a Ruling Pastor in all the Province collectively taken.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>He arrogates this alone as one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> But shew a rule of Christ, why the Elders may not give that to him, and liberty to take many to help him, as well as you joyn many to concurre with him in that work.</p>
                        <p>I believe <hi>he</hi> hath no power to take many with himself to rule a Province of 30 Churches, besides his own. And I beleeve you have no rule of Christ to join many, to rule many Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their own particular charges. A shepherd ought to have but one flock: one is as much as he can rule, one is as much as he hath authority to rule. <hi>Relatorum unum uni tantum.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <q>Neither is this true, because power of jurisdiction is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on power of order, Therefore teaching should be every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable with ruling. For the Eldership convened in Court, and only <hi>formalit√®r in foro Ecclesiae,</hi> in this Court hath Church power of jurisdiction, in a Congregation, and in this Court they govern: But the Eldership in this Court neither doth preach, nor can preach.</q>

                        <p>
                           <hi>There is not the like care, onerousnesse and labour required in duties of Christian watchfulnesse in a brotherly way, as to doe the duties to others, to whom we are bound in way of office-relation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>this imparity</hi> appears, partly, in <hi>the preparations</hi> required to the services; partly, in the <hi>execution</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For <hi>preparation</hi> to the work of <hi>teaching,</hi> which the Pastor and Teacher are to attend, by their places, <hi>labouring in word and doctrine,</hi> (that as good stewards they may lay in provision old and new, and be able to divide the word of truth aright) they are to bestow their <hi>whole time</hi> and strength, and that constantly to this end.<note place="margin">1 Tim 4.13, 16.</note> Therefore they are enjoyned to <hi>attend to exhortation and teaching,</hi> the main bent of their daily studies must goe that way. They must search to know the state of their flock, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.10.</note>
                           <hi>and study pleasant words,</hi> which may with most plainnesse, and profit, and power convey the truth to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the meanest under their charge. And therefore <hi>they must not be intangled in the affairs of this life.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.4.</note> They must lay aside <hi>the attending of tables,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 6.4.</note> and give <hi>themselves to the word and praier.</hi> The Apostles professed to take this course (though extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily gifted and assisted) as occasion did require.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 6.2, 3, 4.</note>If the Apostles laid aside the care of the poor in dispensing the treasury, because that would hinder the work of the Ministery; if there had been any work of <hi>like</hi> care and onerousnesse, <hi>Why should they not have laid aside that also?</hi> I cannot see it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they judged not the exercising the acts of Christian helpfulnes of this nature.</p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:111062:75"/>
                        <p>In a word, to make preparation for the work of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the publike dispensation and administration of Christs holy things, if the improvement of time and strength be constantly required, if brotherly <hi>consociation</hi> required the <hi>like care,</hi> and laid the like onerousnesse upon a Pastor in Christian duties of love, they were no more able to discharge both, then to be <hi>Pastors to two or three Congregations,</hi> which all men confesse to be crosse to Gods command. But blessed be God it is far otherwise. His waies are full of mercy, wisdome, pity and goodnes, and he exacts no more of his people, then in an evangelical way they are able to performe.</p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>in</hi> our <hi>Christian watch,</hi> I am bound only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister <hi>occasionally,</hi> rebukes, counsels, comforts and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I meet with brethren of other Congregations, and I see their occasions require it, so far as God puts present ability or opportunity into my hand, all which labour and burthen is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the nail of the little finger, compared with the body of that care and burthen, which concerns a Teacher in office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those, to whom he is bound by that relation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Look we again into the <hi>dispensation and execution</hi> of these services, the <hi>imparity</hi> also will appear plainly.</p>
                        <p>If an officer hear of a scandalous course of such, who be his sheep, he is bound to make diligent search touching the truth thereof, and upon proof made, he is bound to convince and admonish: If he shall not hear, to take one or two; if not hear them, then to complain to the Church, of such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> thus I am <hi>not bound</hi> to bestow my time, and imploy my care <hi>with all Christians,</hi> with whom I shall meet, in the compasse of the <hi>same Classis, or the same Province:</hi> for it is impossible, I should so doe. If I hear of many scandals, that many have given in severall Congregations, Countreys, nay, as the occasion of travelling and merchandizing may require; a man shall be forced to see many in many places: Must now the traveller or merchant lay aside all his businesse, and deal with all these? Or in case he return home, the pressures of his imploiments calling him thither, Must he needs go into <hi>France, Germany, Holland,</hi> to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Delinquents? I suppose each man sees the absurdity without spectacles. Its impossible any man should attend such a proceeding. And therefore, blessed be our Saviour, who never
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:111062:76"/> required it, never laid such a burthen upon any to practise in this manner; but hath provided in his infinite wisdome a nearer course, which may be followed, with comfort and conveniency: <hi>He hath appointed guides in every Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> who are <hi>eyed wings</hi> to the people, over whom they are placed; they are at hand, they are by office appointed to deal in such cases, and they live and converse one with another, have charge over them, and authority put upon them to that purpose, and are set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from other entanglements to attend the improvement of all ordinances, for the good of those under their charge, that their evils may be seen, searched and reformed.</p>
                        <p>Nor let any man think to ease this inconvenience, by saying, that a person is a <hi>proper Pastor</hi> to the one, and a <hi>Pastor</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                           </gap> to the other removed: for <hi>this device,</hi> like a warm hand, strokes the sore, but will not cure it. For by this <hi>it is granted, that pastoral care is far more onerous and laborious, then Christian and brotherly care in some sense,</hi> which is now our question.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Its affirmed in the place, and often expressed by M. <hi>R.</hi> That there is but <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>same office,</hi> whence all this watchfulnesse issues towards all. And therefore as it hath the same bond, so it requires the same service: And therefore all such conceits are meerly coined, to <hi>cousen mens</hi> consciences, and so to keep them quiet, but they will never goe at the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                        <p>For the question will be, <hi>Hadst thou the same pastoral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the one as to the other, as thy sheep?</hi> If thou stoodest bound to them as thy sheep, by the same Office and Call, the needs of both thou wert bound to supply, and the good of both thou wert in like manner bound to promote, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.13, 14.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But lastly, M.<hi>R.</hi> his own expression will not admit any such consideration, as this: for he intends the comparison betwixt <hi>brotherly care</hi> and <hi>pastoral care</hi> to a mans proper stock. For his words are these,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I clear it in this, namely, That there is as great care and onerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> lies upon a brother, as upon a Pastor, in the watching for the good of a brother. A man is a gifted preacher in a Congregation, in an Island, there is no other gifted of God to preach the Gospel, but he only: I would thinke, as a brother, he were under as great an obligation of care and laborious onerousnes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:111062:76"/> of conscience, to bestow his talent for the gaining of souls by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though he were not called to be their Pastor, as if he were called to be their Pastor.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The case is here evident, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>R.</hi> his intendment is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>care of a Pastor over his proper flock,</hi> and <hi>brotherly care</hi> over <hi>Christians together.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And here also I must crave leave to <hi>differ</hi> wholly from M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                           <hi>R.</hi> his opinion. For it is granted, that this gifted person is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to preach, nor will the people in the Island so acknowledge him: Therefore they are not bound to maintain him: Hence I should rather think thus,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He that useth his generall calling so, as that he destroies his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he useth it disorderly:</hi> For these are in subordination, not in opposition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But so to preach</hi> (being gifted, as in the example given) <hi>is to use his generall calling</hi> (for he doth what is done out of Christian charity) <hi>so as that he destroies his particular:</hi> For he must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lay aside <hi>the attending tables,</hi> i. e. his worldly occasions: that would and did take his time and strength, if he come to bestow himself in his preparations and dispensations in a Pastor-like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>i. e.</hi> as <hi>Pastors</hi> use to do.</p>
                        <p>Besides, To doe as much in a generall way of charity, as that which amounts to the work of a particular calling, is <hi>to confound generall and particular callings,</hi> which God, and rule have distinguished.</p>
                        <p>When M.<hi>R.</hi> saith,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I desire to know what the naked relation of authority or jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on addeth to this care and onerousnesse in point of labour by preaching the Gospel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its easie to return, That <hi>Jurisdiction implies an office:</hi> an office doth not only add a speciall bond, but requires more service with the greater improvement of time, and strength, and constancy therein, as it hath appeared before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>two Reasons,</hi> which M.<hi>R.</hi> propounds for proof of the conclusion, have not solidity enough to settle the understanding of a man seriously judicious.</p>
                        <p>The frame of the first <hi>Reason</hi> of M.<hi>R.</hi> is this,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If we have a divine command to be our brethrens keepers, then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:111062:77"/> our watch in that regard carries and requires as much care and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse as office-watch.</q>

                        <head>Answer.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>consequence</hi> is to be denied, as no way sutable to the rule of truth, as it hath appeared at large in the former enquiry, and this one thing is also enough to make it palpable. I am bound by that divine command to keep many brethren from danger, with whom I occasionally meet with once or twice in my life: and therefore can relieve them no more: Am I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound by my office to watch no more, nor lend no further relief to such as be committed to my care? Will it go for good pay at our appearance before Christ, to say, I am bound by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to watch no more over the people left to my care and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then I am bound as a Christian to be my brothers keeper, in a Classis or Province? Many of them I could never see, or very seldome lend any succour unto in all my life: Therefore I am bound to doe no more to those that are under my charge: If I occasionally meet with them, to doe good occasionally to them, but never to bestow my time and strength constantly to attend their comfort, to binde up the broken, to recall those that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray, and to heal and help the feeble. The second Reason comes out of the same mint, and in form its thus.</p>

                           <q>If the foundation of governing a classical Church be the love and union of the members of one body of Christ: Then there is as much care, onerousnes and labour, which is required in brotherly conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation to help, as the care and onerousnes, which is required in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-help, or that which is required in the jurisdiction, which comes from officers.</q> The first part is true: Therefore</p>

                        <p>The Proposition deserves a <hi>deniall,</hi> as not having a semblance of truth in it. <hi>Because I love</hi> all such as are consociated with me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one National Synod, whom I never had a sight of, never came to speech with all, with whom I could never meet to doe good to them, or receive any good from them in converse: That <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> I should stand bound to put forth the like onerous, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care for their spirituall good, as a person that stands charged with them in <hi>way of office,</hi> one would certainly conclude and readily, either those officers doe too little, or else I am bound

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:111062:78"/> was <hi>wholy distinct</hi> from that Kingly power, that each King had in his own kingdom, and was received, when by the choice of the people or the Parliaments in all the kingdoms, they set up all those confederate Princes: Suppose the <hi>King of Edom, Babylon, Emperour of Persia, Prince of Transilvania, Duke of Florence:</hi> &amp;c. this one and joint power of confederate Princes, to act in such a manner, in such things, with such limitation, as distinct from that particular princely power they had in their own territories. This is the truth in the example, and <hi>let M.</hi>R. <hi>parallell</hi> this in the case in hand, and <hi>we shall soon come to an agreement,</hi> namely,</p>
                        <p>That the Elders who had speciall office, and the power of it in their proper charges, yet when by the combination of all the Churches they are to meet in a Classis, and have power put upon them to act in such things and in such a manner, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had before; this is <hi>not now an office of a Pastor, but the power of a Commissioner,</hi> wholly <hi>distinct</hi> therefrom; and that is a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creature</hi> of mans devising: the <hi>Churches</hi> dealing therein, as the <hi>civil states</hi> do, who have allowance, and they in this case take allowance to adde and institute <hi>new places</hi> and <hi>new powers</hi> in the Church, so that they were <hi>all</hi> chosen <hi>Commissioners,</hi> but never a one of them was <hi>a Pastor,</hi> which is that which M.<hi>R.</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and yet this frame is not able to gainsay it.</p>
                        <p>The issue then is, had they been <hi>Pastors,</hi> they must have been chosen and maintained, which was the consequence of the reason, and stands untouched, upon that supposition. But they are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners:</hi> And that his words intimate, which the nature of the thing forceth unto, that <hi>they promise tacitely obedience</hi> and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to every one of the Kings of the nations, not simply <hi>as</hi> they are <hi>Kings</hi> in relation to such a kingdom; that is, by <hi>parity,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <hi>of reason,</hi> the people promising subjection <hi>to Elders,</hi> not <hi>as to Pastors,</hi> but <hi>as to Commissioners, which are humane creatures of mans devising.</hi>

                        <p>The Classicall Church consisting of so many Elders in a Church representative, meeting together, to exercise Jurisdiction by joint concurrence: therefore the acting and issuing of determinations and censures, must either be carried on by the joint agreement of all, or else of the major part: for if the fewer or lesser number might cast the ballance in cases propounded, then the weaker should overbear the stronger (for they have all equall power in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111062:79"/> the Commission to the work) and then some few of those to go on one side, and many on the other side, if the fewer should have the casting voice, then the lesser weight should carry the scales against the greater, which is irrationall. Again, upon this ground, the part should not only over-rule, but destroy the whole, which is absurd. Whence then it is plain, that the <hi>greater part hath the power in their hand,</hi> to passe sentence in way of decision, as when it is past, to put it into execution.</p>
                        <p>But what if the <hi>most</hi> have the <hi>worst</hi> cause, and erre in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice?</p>
                        <p>The answer is, While the fewer do protest against their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they quit their hands of sin, and that is all they can do: but the sentence must take place: only, if there be a way of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal left, they may take the benefit thereof in their opportunity.</p>
                        <p>These premised, which cannot be denied, I thus <hi>reason.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>That course of government, which nullifies the power of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and people of the Congregation, and their proceedings in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous way, that is not a power of Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this doth so:</hi> as instance,</p>
                        <p>The greater part of the <hi>Classis</hi> may <hi>sentence a member</hi> of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church to be excommunicated, <hi>when the Elders and all the people judge</hi> and that truly, <hi>not</hi> to be worthy of that censure: here the power of the Elders and people which act in a way of Christ is wholly hindered.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. But this we have heard is crosse to all the orderly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, and rules of reason, that the <hi>weaker should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the stronger, the part, the whole.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Would you see a person</hi> that hath the formall essence of a Pastour, and yet <hi>never</hi> did, nor is <hi>bound to preach?</hi> so a Classicall Elder is to his Classicall Church, and why may <hi>not a Bishop also have the like?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Would you see a person, that hath the Office of <hi>a Pastour to teach,</hi> but must have no power to rule in chief acts of jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>behold it is the poor Pastor of a Congregation,</hi> preach he may, and administer the Sacraments he may in his own Congregation; But the Classis keeps the key of Iurisdiction, they must send in his censures, excommunications. And why may <hi>not a Bishop do so,</hi> if ye will?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Would ye see a person exercise <hi>Jurisdiction over Churches,</hi> and yet <hi>not be bound to preach</hi> to them? behold the Classicall Pastor doth so, And therefore <hi>why may not a Bishop rule a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi> and preach only at his Cathedrall?</p>
                        <p>It is all that can be said, that many are joyned with that one in joint power to do this.</p>
                        <p>True, But what if the Elders met in the <hi>Classis,</hi> should give power to <hi>one man to take many to himself,</hi> and exercise all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction without them, not as a Moderatour only, to order the actious of the Assembly, but as having the power of a judge.</p>
                        <p>HE IS THEN A PERFECT BISHOP.</p>
                        <p>And I desire a rule of Christ from the Churches in the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to convince the Elders meeting of an errour for choosing one amongst themselves, and putting upon him the Jurisdiction of a Judge, <hi>which will not condemn themselves for choosing many Elders of other Churches, and investing them with Jurisdiction</hi>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:111062:81"/> of Judge-like authority over so many other Churches, beside their own.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>if</hi> they have liberty to institute and commit <hi>a power to many</hi> which Christ never appointed, why may they not have the same liberty to institute <hi>a power,</hi> and commit it to one which Christ never appointed?</p>
                        <p>For when it is affirmed and confessed, that one Congregation hath no power over another, therefore if they receive this power over other Congregations, Its not the Office of a Pastour or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that gives that power, for that they had compleatly when they were officers but of one Congregation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the power they receive from the combination must be no office-power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore it must be some other power, beside that.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore Combination gives some power to many, beside the power of office,</hi> that Christ hath not appointed, and that is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention.</p>
                        <p>And why may they not give the like power <hi>to one man?</hi> and let him take <hi>Surrogates, Deans, Arch-deacons,</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours</hi> to himself: this is but a humane invention, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>In a word, let M.<hi>R.</hi> give me but <hi>one place of Scripture,</hi> or one sound <hi>reason</hi> for it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <q>In that it is a little City, and a little kingdome of Jesus Christ, having within it self power of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>And also that it is a Church, and hath the essence of a Church, to which agree the essentiall notes of a visible Church. Now preaching of the word, and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are essentiall notes of a visible Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>this ground</hi> I would thus reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If a Church in an Iland may dispense all the censures and all the ordinances then every particular Congregation may.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the first is granted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the second cannot be denied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition is evidenced many</hi> waies. <hi>Where</hi> there is the same power appointed to the same ends, there may be and indeed ought to be the same operations. <hi>But</hi> in every visible Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rightly constituted, there is the same power, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the same ends.</p>
                  <p>This second part admits no deniall, because sense and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence give in testimony. There be all the Officers which Christ hath appointed in the one as in the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All</hi> are enjoyned to put forth <hi>all their operations,</hi> and to fullfill the work of their ministery, and the duties of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, one as the other, and the <hi>end is the same in both,</hi> the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and perfecting of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition is proved from that principle of reason, that <hi>operari sequitur esse,</hi> The operation answers the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third ground</hi> formerly laid, confirms the same.</p>
                  <p>Where there is an Office or power appointed by God, there needs no other power, but the Office, to authorize to the work, and it requires the performance of it.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, If the power be the same, and the end the same, then the power must be <hi>frustr√†</hi> and in vain, if it should not be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:111062:82"/> put forth to the end. And the power should be wronged, and the institution of Christ also, if it should be hindered in the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that end.</p>
                  <p>And let any man shew any power, right or ability, that a Church in an Iland hath to dispense any Ordinance: and it will clearly appear every particular Congregation hath as much, For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the dispensations of such a Church issue from the <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall power</hi> of the Rulers called by Christ to the work, and so it doth in all other Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If neighbourhood of other Churches, be but a separable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,</hi> it can add nothing <hi>to the constitution,</hi> and so to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church, for the nature of such adjuncts touch not the essence or constitution of the thing in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But neighbourhood is but a separable adjunct,</hi> as experience and common sense can testify; because either death, or dissention may take away some Churches, and nullifie them, and yet some particulars are preserved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Suppose</hi> a Church gathered and erected on a continent in the wildernesse, and is there alone. If this Church could act all these censures, and dispense all Ordinances, before any other was planted by them: and if those that come after, do abridge them of that liberty, <hi>they have power over them:</hi> but power they have none, for one Congregation hath not power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Besides,</hi> Those operations which a Congregation puts forth, out of the authority of the Office and Officers, which they have received from Christ, and for which they are called, those operations ought not to be abridged.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Nay,</hi> If the Officers and Offices remain the same, they ought not, they cannot be abridged. Where the same intrinsecall power of constitution according to God remains unaltered, there the operations remain the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>If it be said,</hi> they should submit to a combination of Churches, as well as combine as members of a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is, <hi>Petere principium,</hi> To beg the question.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppose they will not, then the other Churches cannot exact or command that, no more then a particular Congregation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:111062:82"/> can command me to be a member.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ought not so to combine as to prejudice the operations of that power, which they have received of Christ, and which they are injoyned to put forth accordingly. And let there be any warrant shewed out of the word, that any person or Church hath power to hinder the operation of a Pastour or ruling elder, in any one act of his office, more then in another.</p>
                  <p>And Lastly, It hath been proved, that the addition of any thing besides an Office adds no power or right of Jurisdiction. Ground third <hi>supra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the <hi>ground</hi> of the combination be of no force, nor carries any validity with it. Then the combination and classis falls with it.</p>
                  <p>But the ground which is given, is a meer fallacy, and hath no validity in it, Namely, <q>The preventing or curing the taint and pollution that a scandall will bring by the neernesse of cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is no ground it will thus appear.</p>
                  <p>If the scandall in an ordinary course may, and will fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that are nearer, then many in the combination: then this neernesse is not a sufficient cause of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At primum:</hi> As in case members trade among people of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Classis, and give scandalous example there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who live at the outside of the combination, are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Congregation of another Classis then their own.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Scandall given, it goeth far and wide into the provinces and nations also.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the righteous proceeding according to the rule of Christ in a particular Congregation is a cure appointed to remove the polluting and infecting power of the scandall, be it done never so far off, or never so neer.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Congregations be <hi>species specialissimae</hi> of a true Church, then there can be no lower <hi>species</hi> resulting or arising from them, as this doth,</p>

                  <p>Hence an <hi>Answer</hi> may be easily accommodated to the <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which M. <hi>R. brings,</hi> for the evidencing of a <hi>Presbyterian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That of the <hi>Apostles Church</hi> will in no wise suit his end, or serve his turn, or make good the question. For to make up a <hi>Presbyteriall Church,</hi> there must be <hi>many Congregations, many Elders appropriated</hi> to these Congregations, which have power over <hi>their own only,</hi> and not over others: These must combine, and upon the combination these Elders must assemble, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense their censures, and set down their decisions.</p>
                  <p>But there were no Elders appropriated to their severall charges
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:111062:83"/> and Churches, which had power only over them. And <hi>such El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Apostles could not be,</hi> because though they had <hi>all</hi> power in them, yet <hi>they had no power limited,</hi> for that did <hi>implicare,</hi> and contradict their Apostolicall commission.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the examples, of <hi>Antioch, Ephesus, Rome,</hi> though it were granted, that upon their greater growth and increase, and so want of Elders, they might meet in divers places <hi>for the while,</hi> these might still be under one Presbytery, their Officers in a distinct manner attending upon them. And therefore <hi>Gersom Bucerus</hi> his answer suits here, <hi>Quis ade√≤ ineptire sustinuerit,</hi> &amp;c. that because they met in divers places they were under divers Presbyteries or Elders.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth not appear out of any text, nor any evicting argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gathered therefrom, that (setting aside the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>) they should need meet in severall places.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let it be considered, whether by <hi>Church,</hi> many Churches may not be intended, <hi>as Saul made havock of the Church,</hi> i. of all the faithfull members of <hi>all Congregations.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>WHich we shall suddenly dispatch, because we have held the Reader somewhat with the longest in this debate. His first argument is taken from the Church mentioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and his reason is this. <q>If Christ alludeth here to the Synedry and consistory of the Jews, with which his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were well acquainted: Then a Presbyteriall Church of Elders collected and combined from many Congregations, is here understood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But our Saviour alludes here, unto the Synedry and Consistory of the Jews.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>A Presbyteriall Church is here understood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. Both</hi> the Propositions may safely be <hi>denied:</hi> nor is there any evidence that can evict the certainty of them: for as M. <hi>Robinson</hi> saies well, <hi>The manner of our Saviours proceeding is so plain and obvious to an ordinary apprehension, that it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily and familiarly be perceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The alluding to the Jewish <hi>Synagogue</hi> would add little light to the processe now propounded: Should our Saviour mean a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Syoagogue,</hi> they had <hi>not the power of excommunication</hi> in their hands: for the Church of the Jews was <hi>a nationall Church,</hi> and unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the males were bound to repair three times in the year: and if they were <hi>not cast out from hence, no excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication could be compleat.</hi> For they had their liberty thither to appeal in weightiest matters, and the delivering a man to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was a matter of greatest consequence, that could befall him, and therefore he would in reason see the through tryall. And to say, that our Saviour alluded to <hi>the nationall</hi> Church of the Jews, is to confound the goverment of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> with that of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:111062:84"/>2. This were to send a man to a <hi>generall counsell,</hi> not to a Classis yea to send him thither, where he was not like to finde relief: for the plantiffe might be dead and buried, before the Councell could be gathered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The direction of our Saviour points out apparently some stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Tribunall,</hi> and that <hi>at hand. Such</hi> a Church whereof <hi>both the parties were members:</hi> That when two witnesses could not set down the offender, The Lord Christ raised an <hi>whole Church,</hi> as the body of the army, to overbear his obstinacy: I would willingly see how a Church in an Iland, a solitary Church upon a continent, or haply two Congregations sitting down together, or how the first Church at <hi>Jerusalem, Act.</hi> 1.23. could take any warrant to exercise any act of discipline against an offender from this place; or from any word of the Gospel, <hi>∆≤PON THIS GRO∆≤ND.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, It doth not follow the allusion had been to a Classis (for there were none but a national Church) but rather to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory suitable to the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> also admits a just deniall: for an <hi>allusion</hi> is only a similitude: and the <hi>similitude</hi> may lie in some particular, beside the <hi>quality of</hi> the Judge, as thus. As the offender that would not hear the supream Judge was cut off, so look you must at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, as the chief tribunall; and therefore he who will not hear her speak, let him be cast out and accounted as no member of the Church.</p>
               <p>And that the resemblance could not lie in the <hi>Iudge,</hi> this seems to evidence it; because the Judgement in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> was <hi>mixt</hi> (as the phrase intimates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.) part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> partly of <hi>civill Iudges,</hi> who, as the case did require, had their hands and voices in the verdict, which carries no resemblance in our Church-work.</p>

                     <q>Those to whom the essence and definition of a ministeriall Church, having power to excommunicate, doth necessarily belong: these and these only, are understood under the name of the Church. But so it is, that the essence and definition of a Ministeriall Church having power to excommunicate, agreeth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to a great Company of beleevers assembled Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</q>

                     <p>Both the propositions with a fair interpretation admits a deniall, as being clearly false.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>proposition.</hi> Because a Church neither as <hi>Totum essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale</hi> alone, or as it ariseth to be <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> is here only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. But the second sense and signification is here firstly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; because both <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>elders</hi> have their power, <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>places</hi> in this work in a right order and manner: when there be Elders, they must lead: but when there are none, the Church can exercise many acts without them, or can elect them, and with them exercise all the rest. So that when it is said, a <hi>Ministeriall Church is here understood,</hi> the word <hi>ministeriall</hi> admits severall significations; either Ministers without the body <hi>exclusiv√®,</hi> and that is false: or the <hi>Ministers with the</hi> body <hi>inclusiv√®,</hi> Now a <hi>Ministeriall</hi> Church in the fairest sense aims at both. In the <hi>first</hi> sense the Proposition is false, in the <hi>second</hi> it doth not conclude. To whom the essence and definition of a Ministeriall Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Church of Ministers without the body having power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate doth necessarily belong, these and these onely are here understood. This is false, and M. <hi>R.</hi> himself will refuse it. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. p. 226.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Minor</hi> involves many things in it, and therefore it only troubles. For when its said, <hi>The essence of a Ministeriall Church, to whom power of excommunication appertains, agrees not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to a company of beleevers.</hi>

                     <p>Here be three things
<list>
                           <item>1. There is a Ministeriall Church.</item>
                           <item>2. This hath power to excommunicate,</item>
                           <item>3. This agrees not to beleevers.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is confessed, and hath been largely proved, that by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of a visible Church, we mean such, who are so visible to the view of charity, though not such in truth. And therefore I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that M. <hi>R.</hi> should again trouble himself to prove that which no man denies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That these beleevers combined are a Church before they have guides, and have power also to excommunicate, that we hold. But they have not a <hi>ministeriall</hi> power taken in the <hi>narrowest and strictest sense,</hi> as here; they have not formally the power of Office, <hi>potestatem Officij,</hi> yet <hi>potestatem judicij,</hi> the <hi>power of judgement</hi> they have, as after shall appear.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>If the house of Clo√´ complained of an open fault to the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Paul to crave his directions and help in way of reformation, having authority in all Churches then complaints must be to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only, and excommunication acted only by them, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Holy Ghost gives direction and rules about receiving complaints to the Eldership.</q> Tit. 1.13.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Answ.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The consequence is denied. For <hi>Clo√´</hi> might have made her complaint to <hi>ony one</hi> of the <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Corinth:</hi> but chose rather to do it to the <hi>Apostle,</hi> because his Apostolicall power would be helpfull in that case.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When there be <hi>Elders</hi> in a Church, all the complaints <hi>must</hi>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:111062:86"/> be made to them, and the causes prepared and cleared, and then by their means they must be complained of to the Church. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth <hi>Titus,</hi> to hear complaints with the Elders, and <hi>by the Elders</hi> to complain to the Church. Now to reason, complaints must be made by him, and Elders to the Church, <hi>therefore they must be made only to them, and not to the Church,</hi> is a very weak consequence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Its granted by Divines there can be no proceeding to <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> but with the <hi>tacite consent of the people,</hi> therefore to them the complaints of the evills must be made by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Suppose there be <hi>grosse and haereticall doctrine</hi> preached <hi>by Officers,</hi> for which the people may justly reject their Pastours, in case they will not recant, and be humbled, as all confesse: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must the people reject their Pastours for such evills, and never speak to them? or if the evill must be required, and called for to triall, may not a <hi>complaint</hi> be made to these people, before they come to examine and try?</p>
                     <p>Nay suppose all the elders <hi>but one,</hi> in a Congregation should be delinquent, dwelling only by one other Church, should the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints be carried to the <hi>one Elder,</hi> and not be carried by him to the whole body, when it is prepared?</p>

                     <q>The only apparent argument against this interpretation is weak,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:111062:87"/> and therefore this sense must have no strength in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Answ.</head>
                     <p>Both the parts fail, For 1. That is <hi>not the only apparent</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is here remembred, which either is or hath been given by persons of a contrary judgement.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If that was weak, yet it doth not follow, that the different sense is clear, and the interpretation strong: because there may be many <hi>better</hi> reasons rendred happly then there were yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                     <p>But let us attend the evidence, whereby it is proved, that the word <hi>Church</hi> in the new testament is <hi>sometimes taken for Officers only:</hi> M. <hi>Ball</hi> seeing the strength of the reason coming down the Hill upon him, which at least might, and indeed doth cast such a strong suspicion upon the cause here propounded, leaving of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, desolate, destitute of the least loving look of the allowance of any text, that might be a second in the field. The good man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that sagacity and sharpnesse of dispute, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, bestirs himself, and musters up all his forces seeks far and wide to win some consent, but at last all comes to this, That a man <hi>may suppose some such thing here,</hi> but cannot get one place to speak professedly for him.</p>
                     <p>And to say the truth, were the word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> rarely used, and that the thing it self had been out of ordinary consideration, it had been a fair plea to have said, the Scripture is very silent touching this subject, and the word seldome used: and therefore no marvell there wants consent. But when the thing is so often, so ordinarily handled in all the Evangelists and Epistles: the very word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, constantly treating about the same subject, and yet it should never be taken in the new testament in this sense, It gives a shrewd suspicion, and such as cannot be wiped out, nor comfortably borne, that the sense is here fathered and forced upon the place, but is not the naturall and native meaning of it, but some changeling put into the room.</p>
                     <p>Let us then hear what M. <hi>R.</hi> adds. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <q>
                           <hi>The</hi> Angel of the Church of Ephesus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here Angel stands for the whole Church, and the whole Church is wrote unto under the name of the Angel of such a Church, which may thus be demonstrated: because not only the Ministers, but the people, who have ears to hear, are commanded to hear, what the spirit saith unto the Churches.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:111062:87"/>2. The thing now questioned, and to be proved, is, whether the word <hi>Church</hi> is put for Elders. Now I would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M. <hi>R.</hi> or any man can say, that the name Church here is taken for Elders only, all the passages of the text, all the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tell us the contrary, therefore here is not a syllable or a shew of any thing to evince it.</p>
                     <p>When the whole Church is wrote unto, and the Epistle super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to the Angel, this intimates something touching the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the name Angel, but nothing at all touching the name Church, so that the thing is wholly mistaken.</p>
                     <p>Beside, that which M. <hi>R.</hi> would, touching the Angel, will hardly down with any discerning man. True it is, that by Angel many may be intimated, the word being taken collectively, as, <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his tents about the righteous.</hi> This sense hath good Authours, and good reason: but that the whole Church should be understood in that word, will hardly stand with the context: for see how strangely and harshly the words will sound, To the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> i. e. To the <hi>Church of the Church of Ephesus;</hi> I suppose a man will finde lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reason in such Rhetotick.</p>
                     <p>A second place is, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Paul</hi> called in at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>saluted the Church.</hi> It cannot be thought in reason, that the Elders only were there saluted, nor by that word intended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it appears by the next verse, that the Apostles scope was to confirm the hearts of the Disciples in all this voyage of his, and therefore had an eye unto the weakest; and those that wanted his sweet refreshing: and in all probability the Church hearing of his arrivall, assembled to give comfortable entertainment, and so to be comforted by him.</p>
                     <p>The rest of the Answer is not only that which we grant, but the most rigid of the separation prove, that in the old Testament the Hebrew and the Greek word used by the Septuagint is so understood: and therefore it is granted, without any losse to the one, or gain to the other.</p>

                     <q>The Church that the plantiffe must tell, that Church is to admonish publikely the offender. But that is the Church of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>1 Thes. 5.12.13. 1 Tim. 5.20. Luk. 10.16.</hi> for they only
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:111062:88"/> are to receive publike complaints, and to rebuke publikely, as <hi>Tit. 1.13. 1 Tim. 5.19. 2 Tim. 4.2.</hi>

                     <p>This hath been fully answered in the eighth, whether I refer the Reader: only remember he may, that by the order of Christ, the Elders are to receive the complaints, and to prepare them for the Congregation, and then they are to report them unto the people, and they to hear and receive them, and they are to passe a Judiciall sentence, the Elders leading the action in an orderly manner, and taking their consent thereunto. Therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous Corinthian was said to be rebuked of many, and to be judged of them also, and that not only by the judgement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, for so they might judge those that were without, yea they are required legally to forgive him, and therefore they did as legally and Judicially binde him.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, What will M. <hi>R.</hi> say of his exspectants, who preach publikely, and therefore do instruct and reprove publikely, as in 1 Thes. 5.12. 2 Tim. 4.2.</p>

                  <p>The probability here presented is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That Christ could not well mean a visible Congregation of people and Elders convened, <hi>1.</hi> Because if they did convene to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:111062:88"/> worship God in spirit and in truth, they meet in Christs name, but there is some other thing required that the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Church meet for the actuall exercise of discipline: for besides meeting in Christs name, there is required that they meet with <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit and the rod of discipline: so that <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit, as an Elder, is required, who hath the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as requisite to this meeting.</q>

                     <p>Whenever the Church meets in Christs name, she hath Christs power to execute all acts of discipline as well as doctrine, having her right constitution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its clear in the text, the Church might and should have cast out the Incestuous Corinthian without <hi>Pauls</hi> provocation, nay without his knowledge, or consent by sending, and therefore the Church is blamed, in that she did not so.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The holy Apostle for their provocation to the work, and incouragement in it, expresseth his consent, that his spirit concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, and did give full approbation to their proceeding.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This his spirit doth not dispense the excommunication, nor give them power to do that which they could not do before, but incouraged them to go on in the work which they had formerly neglected, and was so necessary to be performed.</p>

               <p n="1">I. The <hi>rise</hi> of this power, and the reason, why it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be attended in a Church constituted, will specially appeare, if we eye the <hi>end,</hi> which alwayes steeres the action among such as be Agents by counsell.</p>
               <p>In all combinations there is and will be some common end: That end must have meanes to attaine it, to these meanes and rules each man must bind himself to attend, &amp; in case he do not, to submit to another, to be directed and reformed, or else to yield to the whole, that he may be consured and removed therefrom. For otherwise the end cannot be attained, nor the meanes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:111062:91"/> with profit, or any powerfull successe in reason.</p>
               <p>For if each man may do what is good in his owne eyes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to his own pleasure, so that none may crosse him or controll him by any power; there must of necessity follow the distraction and desolation of the whole, when each man hath liberty to follow his owne imagination and humorous devices, and seek his particular, but oppose one another, and all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the publike good.</p>
               <p>In the building, if the parts be neither mortised nor braced, as there will be little beauty, so there can be no strength. Its so in setting up the frames of socities among men, when their mindes and hearts are not mortised by mutuall consent of subjection one to another, there is no expectation of any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull proceeding with the advantage to the publike. To this appertains that of the Apostle, <hi>Every one submit unto another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mutuall subjection is as it were the sinewes of society, by which it is sustained and supported.</p>
               <p>Hence every man is above another, while he walkes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rule; and when he departs from it, he must be subject to another.</p>
               <p>Hence every part is subject to the whole, and must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the good thereof, and must be ordered by the power thereof.</p>

               <p>It is the highest law in all Policy Civill or Spirituall to preserve the good of the whole; at this all must aime, and unto this all must be subordinate.</p>

               <p>Hence each man and member of the society, in a just way, may be directed, censured, reformed, removed, by the power of the whole, and each may and should judge with the consent of the whole: this belongs to all the Members, and therefore to any that shall be in office, if they be Members. They are superior as Officers, when they keep the rule: but inferior as Members, and in subjection to any when they break the rule. So it is in any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; so in the Parliament. The whole can censure any part.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:111062:91"/>
               <p>This ground being laid,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Objection,</hi> in which many place so much confidence, is easily answered and the mistake thereof is made manifest.</p>
               <p>If the people should censure the Pastor, then there should be Pastors of Pastors, and the sheepe should be Shepherd, not sheepe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The consequence is feeble, as appears from the former ground; because the People judge not as Officers, but as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the whole, to whom by vertue of the common Lawes of combination, they have subjected themselves in case of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency to be ordered for the Common good.</p>
               <p>The feebleness of this Objection will more fully appeare, if we take it in the like. Take a <hi>Classis;</hi> suppose the severall Pastors or many of them offend, the rest admonish and proceed in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against them: the Objection growes on as strongly; here be Pastors of Pastors.</p>
               <p>Nay yet further, let it bee supposed, which is possible, that all or most of the Pastors offend, and the <hi>Ruling-Elders</hi> with the rest, according to the allowance of <hi>Christ</hi> proceed against them (be it for Heresy or Error broached and maintained) here the inferior do censure the superior, those of one <hi>order</hi> judge such as be of a superior.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>rise</hi> of this power appeares from a principle laid in nature. Its a staple rule, which claimes entertainment without any gainsaying.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>No man by nature hath Ecclesiasticall power over another;</hi> by constraint it cannot be imposed regularly, as in part we have formerly heard. For coactive power expressed by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward constraint and violence, is crosse wholly to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Church, <hi>(Whose Kingdome is not of this world.)</hi>
               </q>
               <p>And therefore from his owne inference, worldly power, and worldly weapons, he wholly rejects, and none of his Churches are to use: these swords are to be put up. The Armes of the Church are holy and spirituall ordinances, they look at spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ends, reach the spirituall man, the conscience, by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall (and therefore so far morall) censures.</p>
               <p>As nature gives not this power, so a Civil Ruler should not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. What ever is done here in the constitution of Churches, is done by an Ecclesiasticall rule, not by a rule of policy.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:111062:92"/>
               <p>What ever is dispensed by an Ecclesiasticall Rule, a Civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot dispense it: because that is his sphere in which he moves, and acts only within that compasse, his end being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>If then nature gives not this: nor Civil authority imposeth this: it comes not by constraint; therefore it must come by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and free consent.</p>
               <p>And the very nature of the practice speakes as much. Why doth this or that man combine with such in such a place, and not with others in another coast? its meerely out of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and free consent on both parts. For as I have no power to presse in upon them, further then they will admit me: no more have they any power Ecclesiastick over me, unlesse I freely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and subject my selfe thereunto.</p>
               <p>If a Christian convert should come from <hi>China</hi> into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey or City, where there be multitudes of Churches set up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Gospel: none of them have power to compel him to joyne with any one more then another, but he may freely choose that which is most suitable to his owne heart and affection, and may be most serviceable to promote his spirituall edification.</p>
               <p>From all which premises, the inference is undeniable, <hi>So far, as by free consent their combination goes, so farre, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the power they have one over another reacheth:</hi> because this is the foundation, upon which it is built, and the root upon which it growes, which I desire may be attended, because we shall be forced to have recourse to this principle in our future proceeding.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The second thing to be enquired, is, The</hi> manner <hi>how this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</hi> Those who are thus met together, having power dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed among themselves, they voluntarily consent to unite this their power, and to devolve it upon one, to whom they will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, walking by rules of Christ, and confining himself within the compasse thereof. So that this right of rule, thus united and devolved upon one, is <hi>Officium,</hi> or the right of Office properly so called.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.12. 1 Cor. 12.28.</note>
                  <hi>Christ gave some to be Pastors, some to be Teachers.</hi> He alone, out of his supreme and regal power, doth furnish them with graces and abilities, appoints the work, laies out the compasse thereof, the manner of dispensing, and the order and bounds of their dispensation.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:111062:92"/>
               <p>The Church by voluntary subjection gives them this united right of rule to be exercised over them, and this is their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling by which they are warranted to act, and to put forth their abilities and Ministerial authority over such a people.</p>
               <p>And hence againe, it is more then plaine <hi>That men may give a call and power to such and such to be Pastors, and yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inference is undeniable, thus,</p>
               <p>A divided right, which is in many, is not an united right yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, and devolved upon one. A divided power is not an united power.</p>
               <p>A Pastors power, or power of Office, is an united power from many. The peoples is a divided power, lying in many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, and therefore not the same.</p>
               <p>Hence the power <hi>of Judgement</hi> is not the power <hi>of Office</hi> and therefore the Fraternity may have the one, when they have not the other.</p>
               <p>Hence, The <hi>Elders</hi> are superior to <hi>the Fraternity</hi> in regard of <hi>Office, Rule, Act,</hi> and <hi>Exercise;</hi> which is proper only to them, and not to the Fraternity.</p>
               <p>The people or <hi>Church</hi> are superior to the <hi>Elders</hi> in point of censure; each have their full scope in their own sphere and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, without the prejudice of the other.</p>
               <p>No man conceives that the place and office of the Major is prejudiced because the corporation can for just causes censure him, though nor any nor all of them can exercise his office.</p>
               <p>No man conceives the place and power of a King prejudiced, because a Parliament for just reasons can proceed against him.</p>
               <p>No man thinks that the honour and supreme Priviledge of an Emperour is impeached, because the Princes and States can depose him, in case he falsify and break the fundamentall lawes of their consociation and agreement.</p>
               <p>Hence, The censure of excommunication for the act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Elders, and Fraternity: only for the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of it, its peculiar to the Elders to be leaders in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thence it is, They are called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:111062:93"/>
               <p>Hence again, they do not give the power (which formerly they had) away from themselves, and cease to be what they were, as in civill offices, and amongst civill persons it usually fals out. A man sels his office, and ceaseth to be what he was before he sold it. Its not so here; but by voluntary subjection, they give an united right to another, which none, nor all of them ever had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi> but <hi>virtualiter</hi> only, &amp; therfore the power of Judgement over each other they keep still, and can by that proceed against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that goes aside, though he was an officer.</p>
               <p>Its true, The Officer may by a superior united right, call them together, they cannot refuse. He may injoine them to hear, they may not withdraw. He may injoin them silence, if they shall speak disorderly or impertinently, he may dissolve the congregation, and they must give way while he delivers the mind of Christ out of the Gospel, and acts all the affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, according to his rule; and as it suits with his mind; he is thus above the whole Church: but in case he erre and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse a rule, and becomes a Delinquent, he is then liable to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and they may proceed against him though not <hi>by any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of office,</hi> for they are not officers, but by <hi>power of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which they do possesse.</p>

                     <p>They who have power to censure and depose their Officers, in case of Heresie or other iniquity persisted in, they have power of judgement formally seated in them over such. This Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition admits no denyall. They who can take power from another, they must of necessity have a power above that other in that regard.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Fraternity</hi> have power to censure and so to depose an Officer, in case of Heresie or iniquity persisted in: for they gave power to their Rulers by election; therefore in case of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:111062:95"/> they may and can take it from them upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple formerly received, therefore they have power of judgement seated in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If it be in the power of the Church and fraternity to admit members, Its then in their power to cast them out (which is an act of judgement) when just cause is given, and they justly deserve it. For admitting in, and casting out carry alike parity and proportion of reason, are of the same and equall extent and issue from the same ground.</p>
                     <p>But it is in the power of the Fraternity to admit members, as it appeares in the admission of Officers, before any can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Either the people have power to put forth a causal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in passing the judgement and censure upon the delinquent, or else it belongs to their place, and is their duty onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                     <p>But this later cannot be granted. To consent to evil, and say Amen to an unjust censure is sinful, and so not their duty: But the sentence given by the Elders may be unjust.</p>
                     <p>To say they may and should dissent, will bring as great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience unto the cause upon their grounds. For if they may and should dissent from the unjust sentence passed, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rule and reason they may hinder the execution of the sentence of Excommunication; for if they will joyntly keep communion with the person, whom they will cast out, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders cannot attaine their end in the sentence. Therefore they are not appointed by Christ to execute the sentence alone; unlesse we shall say, that Christ appoints meanes, which cannot attaine their end, and that in an ordinary course (for this may ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall out) which is to blemish the wisedome and faithfulnesse of our Saviour in managing the affaires of the house of God.</p>

                     <p>Assumption proved.</p>
                     <p>That which crosseth the rule of righteous proceeding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ, that is not Christs meaning in the text.</p>
                     <p>But to understand it of the Presbytery alone, crosseth the rule of the righteous proceeding appointed by our Saviour.</p>

                     <p>That which stops and disannuls the last part and degree of the processe appointed by our Saviour, that crosseth his appointed proceeding in the censure.</p>
                     <p>But this doth so, as shall appeare by a double instance. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose three Elders in the Church, and they all under offence have been convinced in private: one or two witnesses have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and yet they will not heare; what can now be done? The Brethren, who are offended must tell the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the Elders have offended, which was done before, and which to do is irrational, to make the guilty party a Judge in his own cause.</p>
                     <p>Againe, suppose two of the three be offenders, and these two will not heare the first or second admonition, then the aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved party must complaine to the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the third Elder, and so one should be the Church: or else this last degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse should wholly be disannulled: both which are contrary to reason and the wisdome of Christ.</p>

                     <p>But neither of these can be granted as true.</p>
                     <p>To have rule given to one by him to be delegated to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, As to have one cheife (as namely <hi>Peter</hi>) and to have all other to repaire to him, and to derive the power from him, is apparant Popery.</p>
                     <p>And it cannot be delegated to all equally by the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: because those, who are equall in commission, are equall in power, for those two keep pace one with another, and are of equall extent.</p>
                     <p>But its confessed, that all the Rulers, who dispense the <hi>Keyes,</hi> have not equall power. The Teaching Elders are in degree and office both differing from the Ruling Elders, and superior to them,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Let me adde this as a sixth reason.</p>
                     <p>The Church mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. hath power to proceed in Excommunication, against what brother or brethren will not heare it. <hi>If he will not heare the Church, let him be as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Rulers alone have not this power. As instance,</p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:111062:96"/>
                     <p>Suppose that one of the Rulers should complaine of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the fraternity, touching error in doctrine and wickednes in life. In case they will not heare the Rulers, the Rulers may, nay should Excommunicate them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Three or foure Rulers 400 or 500. brethren: which if granted, it will thence follow, these Rulers should not only censure the Church of the fraternity, but destroy themselves also, as Pastors and Rulers. For where there is no Flock, but all scattered, there is no Shepherd. But being lawfully Excommunicated, <hi>ex concessis,</hi> there is no Flock, but all is scattered, therefore their office as Shephers is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
                     <p>Besides it is observed by <hi>Ames,</hi> that a Church or body of a people combining, cannot be excommunicated; because then a Body having and retaining its essence, should be cast out of it, which is impossible.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:111062:97"/> the Church, another thing to be the Church.</q> Its confessed then by all, that Office-power is in the hands of some select per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: but it doth not thence follow, The power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> is firstly in them.</p>
                  <p>This generall answer was enough to put by, what is said in these three first Arguments. But for more full satisfaction, we shall take a more special survey.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Office-power, is but a little part of the power of the Keyes: like the nibble of the Key: and therefore that may well be in Officers, and yet the power of the Keyes not be firstly in them, but in such, who gave that power and gave that office to them; and therefore had a power before, theirs did give what they have, and can take away what they have given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the Officers, but Offices also, are included in the Keyes, as being of that ministerial power, by which that Kingdom of Heaven is opened, and the Gospel dispensed: and both Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Officers, as all ordinances are Christs gift to his Church <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He gave some to be Pastors and Teachers,</hi> and not only <hi>for</hi> his Church, but <hi>to</hi> his Church, as Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> confesseth with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and shall be afterwards more fully disputed. So that these suppose the Church to be before both, and to have the power of both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, I confesse, I cannot conceive, (if any man will give but way to what reason will readily lead unto,) but that he must be constrained to acknowledge, that they cannot be attended under the respect and relation of Officers, to whom the Keyes be promised; for these are Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>These Offices, that essentially include both the power and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Keyes, be given to some select persons.</q> Therfore they are given to some that are not Officers; therefore those cannot undergo the relation or respect of Officers, to whom these Keyes are promised. For how unpleasant, and I suspect also untrue, is such a construction of our Saviours words: <hi>To thee,</hi> who bearest the place and person of an Office, I will give an Office. <hi>Thou who art an Officer, shalt be made an Officer. Thou that hast an Office, to thee I will give an Office,</hi> and yet this must be the sense of the Text, if <hi>Peter to thee I will</hi> sustain the place of Officers here, and not the place and roome of the Church of beleevers: For to them it is given, to invest fit persons with such power of office, that so they may from Christ and by delegation from them execute it,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:111062:97"/> according to the limits laid out by CHRIST.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this compleat power of binding and loosing be given to the Officers firstly: then either as Teaching, or as Ruling, in the <hi>speciall work,</hi> or else as Officers sharing in the <hi>generall nature of rule,</hi> which is affirmed of them both.</p>
                  <p>If this power belong to Teaching, <hi>qua tales,</hi> then to inferre from Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his own ground: <hi>Quod convenit</hi>

                  <p>If it belong to them as <hi>Rulers,</hi> in regard of that <hi>common</hi> or generall nature of <hi>Ruling:</hi> Then is there the equall and same power in both, Teachers and Rulers: For the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the same and equall in both.

                  <p>These things premised, let us take a taste of the particulars.</p>

                     <q>If all the faithfull may not lay on hands, (as <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi>) nor receive witnesses judicially (as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Timothy;</hi>) Then they are not the first subject of the power of the Keyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The consequence is false, even from his own grounds. For the ruling Elders cannot so lay on hands. Nor so receive witnesses judicially, as the teaching Elders doe: and yet they have the power of the Keyes.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <q>To whomsoever Christ giveth the power of the Keyes, to them he gives a Ministeriall Spirit, by way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and speciall embassage to entertaine sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is also unsound upon received principles. For the ruling Elders to whom the power of the keyes is given, yet have not this Ministeriall gift, by way of speciall embassage to bind and loose.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the answer which is here suggested, satisfy, <q>Pag. <hi>9. when it is affirmed,</hi> That the power of Preaching is not given for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to ruling Elders, yet it is effectually in the fruit given to them.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>It hath often been said, and fully opened before: To have power of the Keyes is one thing, and to be Rulers and guides is another: even as far differing, as to say, the Court of Aldermen, or a Common Councell can proceed against the <hi>Major,</hi> being a Delinquent, and yet none of them are in the place and office of a <hi>Major.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence this overturneth not the order established by Christ, because the members and body have this power, and put forth the act, not as Officers, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Hence also there is a peculiar authority of <hi>Office-power,</hi> which is <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>flock:</hi> and yet there is a <hi>power of judging,</hi> which is in the <hi>whole,</hi> and is part of the power of the Keyes: and these two thwart not one the other, which is the <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>eighth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Also many have the power of the Keyes, yea be Pastours, and yet have no faith. <hi>Joh. 6.70. Matth. 7.21.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is something strange to me, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> confessing that those against whom he writes, do constantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that <hi>there is no more, but an unblameable profession of Faith required, to interest a man by way of Charity, to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a visible Saint, and as a member of a Congregation,</hi> and yet so usually and frequently to suppose they required sincerity, or else there would a nullity follow of their membership.</p>
                  <p>I shall shortly recall what hath been recorded upon proofe, and so expedite an easie answer to all that is said. Such visible Saints, which combine in a holy Covenant one with another, and are allowed by Christ as fit to receive delegated power by way of Commission from him: these are the subject of this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall power. So that it is not beleevers, as beleevers, that have this power, but as beleevers Covenanting and fitly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable according to Christs appointment, that are the first subject of this power. For beleevers that are as scattered stones, and are not seated in a visible Church or Corporation, as setled in the wall, these have not any Ecclesicastiall power, according to which they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:111062:99"/> can be proceeded withall, or can proceed with other in like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with themselves. Beside, these beleevers are such in Charity who come into visible combinati≈ç, not such in reality, from these grounds which have been formerly proved and now repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Answer,</hi> is evident. This power is given to <hi>such belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> who are counted fit by Christ and capable, which women and Children, deafe, and dumbe, and distracted are not. And therefore the consequence of the sixt Argument failes in the first branch. <hi>The power of the Keyes doth not make a Pastor,</hi> and therefore its false in the second branch.</p>
                  <p>Againe, though the rule of Master <hi>Rutherford Quod convenit</hi>

                     </gap> failes much, according to the Fundamentall Lawes of Logick, which he will easily find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on second thoughts, and so the bottom of the Argument breakes wholly under him: I shall notwithstanding let that passe, and speake to the matter, wherein there is a worse mistake, because the question is wholly missed.</p>
                  <p>Visible Saints and beleevers accounted according to the rules of Charity, are the subject matter of the Church: and therfore when they are justly excommunicated, though in Gods account and by vertue of that secret seed of Grace, they may be Saints inwardly, yet before their recovery, they are not Saints visible, to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eye of Charity.</p>
                  <p>Againe, close hypocrites, as <hi>Judas,</hi> may be unbeleevers really, and yet seemingly appeare to be Saints. <hi>Is it I Master</hi> say all the Disciples fearing themselves as much, as suspecting <hi>Judas.</hi> And therefore the profession is sufficient to keep such in their Office, and to evidence that all their actions are valide, which they ministerially performe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg</hi> 9. <q>If Christ give his Keyes, he gives answerable gifts to use the Keyes. But such gifts he doth not give to all beleevers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Such onely are to be members of the visible Church, who are in charities judgement visible Saints: and those who are such, they have received an annointing in some measure, as that they will hear and can discern the voice of Christ, and will follow him, and submit to him. Such are able to discerne false Doctrine and false Teachers: such are able to choose themselves Pastors, as being able to relish the favour of spiritual administrations, and to feele what Key will best open their lock: can see and discerne what courses be sinfull and scandalous, persons obstinate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:111062:99"/> therein. If such have power to reject false and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teachers, as well as choose them, they have in reason pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and skill to discern scandalous offenders and to reject them. This is not an <hi>Office-calling,</hi> but <hi>calling to be a member</hi> of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual corporation, which is Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his first demand: and therefore there needs not the tongue of the learned for this work: nor a spirit to come upon them in more then an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner to discharge this judgement. And their carelesnesse in not watching, not <hi>purging</hi> is reproved, 1 Cor. 5.2.3. So Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath all his demands satisfied in so many words.</p>
                  <p>That which is further added by way of inquiry:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>God never cals to a place, but he leaves rules and directions for to order and guide themselves answerably thereunto: But the Word hath no Canons how the people should order the Keyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The places are expresse, the directions plaine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>If thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> wherein the Lord doth as it were put the finger to the fescue, and point out all the severall passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges touching their proceeding, even from the first to the last. And as in one peculiar duty of admonition, wherein the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est both danger and difficulty lay, the Lord is pleased to point out the way, and to put it almost past question: the like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be held, and constantly attended in the other duties of brotherly love, <hi>to build up each other in their most holy faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those that cause dissentions among you, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last dispute of Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> issues from that so ordinary and often mistake, in not differing the <hi>power of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the <hi>power of Office,</hi> and confining the power of the Keyes unto too narrow a compasse, as though the authority of Office was there onely to be attended, when it hath appeared, that it is of farre larger extent: whence the consequence is very feeble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If God require such abilities and qualifications in Officers, which he doth not in all beleevers, then the power of the Keyes is not in the Church.</q> I say, this consequence hath no colour in it. because the power of the Keyes is of larger extent then the power of Office, and thence it is, where the other is not, and requires not so great abilities to the managing thereof, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, which is of greatest eminency.</p>
                  <p>The 10. <hi>Arg.</hi> Which would blemish this opinion, because it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:111062:100"/> makes the <hi>Government</hi> of Gods house <hi>Democraticall,</hi> is reserved to another place, where our answer shall attend it; only for the present, we shall record that staple rule.</p>

                     <hi>The Government of the Church,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Body of the people</hi> is <hi>Democraticall:</hi> in regard of the <hi>Elders Aristocraticall;</hi> in regard of <hi>Christ,</hi> truely <hi>Monarchicall.</hi> And its such a compound of all these three, as that a paralell example to the like perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not to be found on earth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>The Keyes are given to Peter, as representing the Church-Guides especially, though not excluding beleevers, giving to them popular consent: and not to believers as united in a company of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in Church-Covenant, excluding the Elders.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are his own words, which if we compare them with our former explications of the first subject of Ecclesiasticall power, it will appear to any that will lay aside prejudice, That <hi>we so give the power Ecclesiastick to the Church of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> radically, <hi>that by their means we communicate the power of office to the Elders, and do seat office-rule</hi> formally <hi>in them.</hi> So that they are not excluded from having power, but not to have it first, but receive it from the Church; who under Christ, and according to his appointment, convey the same by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it here also be remembred, which is yielded on all hands, that by keyes in this place, not some, but all delegated power is to be understood, which is appointed by Christ, as sufficient to attain his end of binding and loosing, opening and shutting heaven.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>The Church of beleevers combining in Church-Covenant, but wanting their Pastors and Teachers, is not wisedomes house, nor builded by Pastors, and Doctors given to edify and gather the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but they are only the materials of the house, yea wanting the Pastors, they want ministeriall power for pastorall preaching and administring the seales.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The assumption fails: and all the proofs are not able to prop it up from falling to the ground. For they are but bare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of many particulars; which either are so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, or mistakes of things that have some truth in them. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is untrue, that combined believers in Church-Covenant, wanting Pastors, are not wisedomes house, since we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved that <hi>such a Church,</hi> taken as <hi>Totum essentiale,</hi> is before officers, and may be without them, and what can be more plaine, when the Scripture affirms, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>That the Church by lifting up of hands did make and choose them El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi> in reason they must be before their Elders. When <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the <hi>Elders to watch over the flock, over whom the Lord had made them overseers,</hi> he implyes, there is a flock distinct from their overseers; when the Church rejects her officers as haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doth she then destroy her selfe, and cease to be a Church, because they cease to be officers?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is untrue, that believers thus covenanting are only the <hi>materials</hi> of the house; when we have formerly proved, that <hi>such a confederating</hi> company, hath the <hi>materials</hi> and <hi>formals,</hi> required to the constitution of an house. If <hi>combination</hi> can make a <hi>Presbyteriall Church,</hi> why not also a congregationall Church?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a mistake and not a full explication, of that which hath a truth in it. <hi>i. e. That wanting Pastors, they want the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of edifying the body of Christ,</hi> which is required in a visible Church. For the answer is, when they want <hi>Pastors,</hi> they want

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:111062:102"/> that power that <hi>Totum Organicum</hi> hath to edify: but they want not that power, with a Church, taken as <hi>Totum essentiale,</hi> should have to edify it selfe: but it hath power to chuse officers, and so to provide for pastorall preaching and administration of the seales by their meanes.</p>
                  <p>Lastly let Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> tell us, how God <hi>set Teachers in the Church,</hi> if Teachers are before the Church.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. <q>To these are the keyes here promised, who are stewards of the mysteries of God, <hi>1 Cor. 4.1.</hi> servants of his house, <hi>2 Cor. 4.5.</hi> who are to behave themselves well in Gods house, <hi>1 Tim. 3.15.</hi> who are to cut the word aright. But a company of Beleevers in Church Covenant, and destitute of officers, are not stewards by office, therefore to such a company the <hi>keyes are</hi> not given. The Proposition is proved by the allegation of severall testimonies of scripture and consent of interpreters; the <hi>clavis,</hi> a key, signifies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-power. <hi>Isa. 22.22. Isa. 9.6. Rev. 3.7. Rev. 1.18. Rev. 9.1.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If by <hi>stewards</hi> we must understand those who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and intended in the places quoted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. &amp;c. Its certain <hi>the Ruling Elder</hi> must have <hi>no key</hi> of binding and loosing, opening or shutting: for all those places do properly intimate the <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Pastors office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The proofs, brought here for confirmation of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, do not touch the thing at all, for which they are brought; or else they reach not the Conclusion in the right and full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which they should have confirmed; Most of them make nothing to the purpose, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. all which speak of the supreme and <hi>monarchicall</hi> power of Christ, and therefore do not in the least measure look at that <hi>Stewardly</hi> and delegated power of which we speak, and the texts speak, and the proposition speaks in expresse termes, for which they were brought.</p>
                  <p>So that there remains but one more (<hi>Isa.</hi> 22.22.) to be considered; that also comes not home to the conclusion, which was to be setled: only proves that which no man ever (I think) denied, that <hi>key</hi> in phrase of Scripture, sometime signifies a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given to <hi>a Steward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is this to the place <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. or our purpose? for this may be granted; that <hi>key</hi> sometime signifies a <hi>power</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to an <hi>office,</hi> and yet by <hi>keyes</hi> here are not meant that power
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:111062:102"/> only, much lesse a power firstly delegated to them. And if the <hi>Reader</hi> be pleased to recall some things formerly propounded, this will readily appear. By <hi>keyes</hi> is here meant <hi>all power,</hi> which serves for the <hi>shutting</hi> and <hi>opening</hi> the doors of the house <hi>(ut supra)</hi> but beside a <hi>stewardly</hi> power, there is requisite for this end, a power of the <hi>spouse</hi> and <hi>wife</hi> of the family; to <hi>her</hi> it is the Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>her</hi> husband, hath given power to admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the family, and reject as just occasion shall require; and in such cases, and for such ends to judge also; because such acts cannot be done without judgement; to <hi>her</hi> it appertains to call the <hi>Steward</hi> to his place, and put him into his place, and so to put a key of office, by election into his hand.</p>
                  <p>The issue hence is this.</p>
                  <p>To those are the keyes here promised first, to whom <hi>firstly</hi> and <hi>originaliter,</hi> though not <hi>formaliter</hi> all power belongs; but to the spouse of Christ, the Church of Covenanting Beleevers, all power <hi>originaliter</hi> belongs: for she can admit, reject, and judge, <hi>she</hi> can call to office, and put in office: and therefore though all power be not <hi>formaliter</hi> in her, yet all comes <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliter</hi> from her.</p>
                  <p>And this hath been the opinion and apprehension of the most judicious in all ages, which makes me wonder why Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> should thus write, <q>I think while of late, never any Interpreter dreamed, that in the text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.</q>
                     <hi>The keyes of the Kingdome</hi> were given to all beleevers, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing beleevers for the <hi>Church;</hi> I say, I wonder he should thus speak; when that man of a large and multifarious reading as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> is, cannot but know otherwise, if he will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call what he knowes; nay let him recall and remember what he wrights. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 21. we oppose <hi>fathers to fathers,</hi> speaking of this point, and therefore confesseth, that the fathers spake and writ so.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <q>To these in this text doth Christ give the keyes, to whom he giveth warrant and officiall authority for the actuall exercise, to wit, of opening and shutting. But this warrant and officiall authority of binding and loosing Christ giveth to Peter onls as representing Teachers and Elders, therefore he only gives to Peter this officiall power, <hi>I will give to thee the keyes,</hi> &amp;c. ther is his power, and authority granted: <hi>and whatsoever shal be bound in earth, shall be bound,</hi> &amp;c. there is his warrant for the exercise of the act of his power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:111062:103"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument labours of the like disease with the former, and the conclusion, in a fair sense, may be yielded without any prejudice to our cause, or hazard to the question contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betwixt us, namely, That only to <hi>Peter,</hi> as representing the place of Teachers, is the <hi>officiall authority</hi> of the keyes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (as will appear in the things premised in the entrance.) <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> may have this <hi>officiall power formally,</hi> and yet the power of the keyes may be <hi>originally</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and this office-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>vertually</hi> proceed from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Proposition is apparantly false, to wit, To them the power is given firstly, to whom warrant and officiall authority for the actuall exercise of the keyes is given: I say this is false; because 1. the <hi>power of the keyes</hi> is far larger then <hi>office-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> as to admit, reject, &amp;c. 2. There is power before <hi>office-power,</hi> which vertually communicates and conveyes it to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who are made pertakers thereof.</p>
                  <p>When it is added. <q>Now if the keyes be not given to Peter, as to a Pastor, then Peter and Pastors by this place as Pastors, neither have the keyes, nor officiall warrant to preach, and to remit and retain sins; and if by this place they have it not, we desire to see a warrant from Christ, before he went to heaven for Pastoral Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the <hi>keyes</hi> be not firstly given to them there, yet here they may have good warrant for their <hi>office-power,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church, who hath received power to admit, reject, judge, choose and refuse, doth by Christs allowance and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant call them to that place, and invest them with that office. Again that Commission <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go preach and baptize,</hi> John 20. <hi>Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, gives</hi> warrant abundantly to that work of preaching.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> lastly addes <hi>p.</hi> 12. <q>To binde and loose are acts of officiall power: <hi>and of Pastors, Rulers, Feeders: I prove the Antecedent, because</hi> To binde and loose by all Interpreters, <hi>Augustine, Cyrill, &amp;c.</hi> and the evidence of Scripture, is, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and pastorall Preaching to remit and retaine sin. But pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preaching doth not belong to beleevers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Binding and loosing,</hi> look at them as in the place, and in their largest sense, they comprehend the exercise of all the acts of the keyes, or Church power, which may attain this end: and those acts are not only by publike <hi>preaching</hi> (for then the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:111062:103"/>
                     <hi>Ruling-Elder</hi> should have <hi>no key</hi> to bind or loose) but also by <hi>admonitions, excommunications, admissions,</hi> which as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, issue from a power of judgeing, common to the people with the Pastor, and not appropriate to the Pastors only.</p>
                  <p>Lastly we so give the keyes to the Church, that yet she doth not exercise any act of <hi>Office-rule</hi> without Officers, whom she cals to that end.</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <q>If Christ neither in Matth. <hi>16.</hi> nor in Matth. <hi>18.</hi> doth say, that the Keyes, for the act of the keyes, (<hi>to wit,</hi> binding and loosing) are given to the Church of beleevers without their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, then neither place proves it. But Christ doth say it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the text doth not beare it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That Christ doth not say it, he proves; because speaking of the Church in the first part of the verse, he changeth his proofe, I will give to thee, not to the Church.</q> But its answered, The promise is made to <hi>Peter,</hi> because he gave a confession of Christ, in the name of beleevers. To this Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> replyes. <q>If the keyes be given to beleevers, so Covenanting; I aske, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be given to them, a true or a false profession interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the neerest cause of the gift of these.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We answer, if by false profession, such a one may be meant, which may agree unto hypocrites, covertly such, yet appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring outwardly unblameable, we grant it.</p>
                  <p>To this Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> replyes. <q>Then the keyes are not given to beleevers, because they are beleevers, and united unto Christ as his Spouse. <hi>2.</hi> then this Author saith amisse, that the Church instituted by Christ is a company of godly men, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was one. <hi>3.</hi> Our brethren prove the keyes to be a part of the liberty of the redeemed ones: but counterfeit professors are not such.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> All these consequences issue from that so often and ordinary mistake of <hi>visible Saints;</hi> and if the Reader shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how to rectify his judgement in the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, the answer will be easie and familiar, namely: <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Saints,</hi> which are members of the Church, they are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to Christ; and not internally <hi>alwayes:</hi> they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and godly to the judgement of Charity, but not in reality and truth: they are redeemed visibly, not inwardly and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously.</p>
                  <p>Its added lastly by Master <hi>Rutherford,</hi>
                     <q>That Christ speaketh
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:111062:104"/> to <hi>Peter,</hi> as one representing the Apostles, and not as to one repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting all beleevers, is cleere, first, because by the confession of our brethren, binding and loosing are denyed to many that make <hi>Peters</hi> confession, thou art Jesus the son of the living God, as to believing Women and Children, and many out of Church-estate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> When Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> makes that the conclusion he would confute, that Christ speaks not to all believers in the person of <hi>Peter,</hi> we affirme the same, and that he knowes, and in many places expresseth; and therefore it was sufficient to lay aside the consideration of all his proofes: yet that we may not leave the place void, we shall speake shortly to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>Let it then be remembred, that <hi>Peter</hi> speakes in the name of a community of Disciples beleeving and professing the faith with one joint consent and agreement. For the words are plain and differencing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.15. <hi>But whom say ye</hi> that I am? <hi>Yea</hi> in way of difference and distinction from <hi>those some</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verses, <hi>Some said, he was</hi> John Baptist, <hi>some</hi> Elias, <hi>others</hi> Jeremias, <hi>or one of the Prophets.</hi> These here understood by <hi>some and others,</hi> were in reason not unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers onely, but man beleevers also, and yet in a differencing way our Saviour adds, whom <hi>say ye</hi> my Disciples, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>. He adds. <q>If beleevers as giving <hi>Peters</hi> confession and builded upon the Rock Christ, by this place are made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall Church by Christ, and gifted with the power of the keyes: then the officiall power of preaching and binding and loosing should be made as stable and firme from defection, as the Church of elect beleevers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Assumption</hi> is denyed: for as it hath been often said, The Church here, to whom the keyes are firstly given, though they have <hi>a vertuall power</hi> to call men in a right order according to Christ, unto Office, yet they have not <hi>formally Officiall</hi> power: nor is the one, I meane <hi>the Officiall power,</hi> of like stability with the Church. For the Church may be without
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:111062:104"/> them, and in case they faile, as in gre t Apostacyes and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall declinings of the Churches, they may, and yet the <hi>visible Church</hi> never did, nor can, so totally faile, as all our Orthodox writers, and Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> confesseth.</p>
                  <p>Object 3. <q>Those to whom Christ gives the keyes, do represent the person of Christ, and who despiseth them despiseth Christ, and he that honoureth them, honoureth Christ, which is evidently spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Ministers of Christ, <hi>Matth. 10.40,</hi> &amp;c. Now Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures never make all beleevers Embassadors in Christs roome, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The representation of Christ as his <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> belongs onely to such who have <hi>Office-p wer,</hi> and are <hi>Rulers</hi> in his house, and this power is but <hi>part</hi> of the power of the Keyes here mentioned: and therefore the Church may be the subject of the Keyes firstly and originally, and vertually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>Office-power</hi> unto her Ministers, whom she cals, though formally she hath not that power, nor so dispenseth it, and therefore the Proposition is to be denyed as apparantly false: namely, those to whom Christ giveth the keyes here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. those represent his person, as Ambassadours, because the Spouse had a power in the family before the Steward was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in to the family by her.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <q>Those to whom the keyes are given, do authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively forgive and retaine sins, and their acts are valid in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But the Church or company of beleevers, wanting their Officers, by no Scripture can authoritatively forgive.</q> When it was answered, that beleevers out of Office may forgive. 2 Cor. 2.10. <q>He replies that the place in the Corinths is controverted, and we doubt not <hi>(sayes he)</hi> but of the same nature, with the power of excommunicating <hi>1 Cor. 5, 4.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That phrase of <hi>Authoritative forgiving</hi> being a little cleared, the stresse of the Objection will readily be taken off.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Authority</hi> in the ordinary speech is sometime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>for power,</hi> and lies in equall latitude with it: but in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per signification, as in this place, its put for <hi>Ruling</hi> and <hi>Office-power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Retaining this sence, which must needs be intended, and the expressions of Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> in this place intimate no lesse: The proposition admits a ready answer by a rationall denyall. There is a <hi>power of judgement,</hi> which the <hi>fraternity</hi> have, and they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:111062:105"/>
                     <hi>forgive judicially.</hi> There is a power <hi>of rule and Office,</hi> and <hi>the Officers</hi> forgive <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> as Rulers. Of the first, the place of the <hi>Corinths</hi> is understood: for any other of other Churches, or such as were of no Church, might, and indeed should have forgiven the incestuous person, <hi>charitatively,</hi> out of charity, as Christians; but its spoken here in reference to his former <hi>censure,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> for his <hi>receiving</hi> in againe, and those in a Church onely must, and indeed can do this.</p>
                  <p>The like and same answer suits the 5 Objection, meerely issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the same mistake, as namely, when he sayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To those only are the keyes given, who having <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit, which is a spirit Officiall to preach and excommunicate, may convene and deliver to Satan.</q>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The distinction of <hi>judiciall and Officiall</hi> powerfully discovers the falsenesse of the proposition, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the power in his first and proper subject, according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer explication.</p>
                  <p>We have now done with all the objections, which we meet withall, touching the <hi>first subject</hi> of Church-power in Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>second book;</hi> unlesse it be those which fall in with a fresh disquisition of the <hi>Catholike visibe Church,</hi> where we shall attend them. Only before I passe from hence, I shall crave leave to offer some things to consideration touching this 16 of <hi>Matth.</hi> A place upon which all sorts have pressed in, first or last, to claim some priviledge to themselves. <hi>The Pope</hi> will needs have all power belong to him as <hi>Peters</hi> successor: <hi>The Prelates</hi> they claim the next place for preeminence as peculiar to them; The <hi>Elders</hi> and Officers of Churches conceive it best suits their ministeriall condition, and now at last the <hi>Fraternity</hi> lay in for some allowance to themselves, and that they were looked at, in the first intent of Christ. My purpose is only to propound some things, that may occasion some wise-hearted to settle the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the text by undeniable evidence; we shall therefore make our approaches upon the sense of the place, by the propositions following.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>single</hi> society here related unto, <hi>cannot</hi> be the <hi>condition of Rulers:</hi> because to the persons here intended <hi>all</hi> power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But <hi>all</hi> power is not given to <hi>the Rulers</hi> firstly. For there is a power before the power of Rulers, to wit power of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so admission into their places, And that both these acts imply a power, is thus made plain.

If excommunication argues a power, then also admission doth the like, in that there is a parity of reason on both sides: one gives that, which another takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>Againe, should the <hi>condition</hi> of an officer or an elder be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, It must be either the <hi>Teaching-elder</hi> alone, and then the <hi>Ruling-elder,</hi> and his power is excluded: or if the <hi>Ruling</hi>-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alone must be meant, then the power of the <hi>Teaching-Elder</hi> must also be denied: and then how can <hi>All</hi> power be here meant by these <hi>keyes?</hi> Nor can the <hi>generall nature of a Ruler,</hi> as belonging to both teaching and ruling be attended. For then both <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>ruling</hi> should have the same equall power, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one and the same commission, but that the word and all wise hearers deny.</p>

The first thing which was of difficult explication, is thus dispatched.</p>
                     <p>The second wherein the greatest stresse lies in this iniquiy, is, <hi>Whether the Church mentioned in that text, be the</hi> visible <hi>or</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Church.</hi>

                     <p>After many thoughts floating in my mind, what might be the meaning of our Saviour, one expression of Mr. <hi>Rutherford, l.</hi> 2. <hi>p</hi> 9. 10. made me recall former considerations. His words are these.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Though the building of this Church on the Rock, Christ, may well be thought to be the inward building of the Catholick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church in the faith of Christ yet as it is promised to the Church, to the which Christ promiseth the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, it can be no other beside externall and ministeriall building by a publike Ministery.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which expressions occasioned me to recover many of those debates, which before had been stirring in my bosome, whether the Church there, might not in a safe sense be conceived to be the <hi>visible</hi> Church: and all things waighed, my apprehensions came to be inclined and byassed that way, and that for this reason, untill better reason appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Church is here meant, which is built upon the rock Christ by the visible confession of</hi> Peter, as explycated immediately before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the invisible Church is not built by a visible profession, such as</hi> Peters <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This second part or Assumption will find ready acceptance, by reason of the opposition betwixt visibility and invisibility.</p>
                     <p>For the Proposition that is made good, by the meaning of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:111062:106"/> words; <hi>Thou hast made a confession of my selfe a rock; and therefore art called</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The main argument that makes against this interpretation is this. That Church is here understood, against which the gates of hell cannot prevaile. But against the visible Church the gates of hell hath prevailed. Therefore.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>By key,</hi> as we have heard, we are to understand <hi>a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated from Christ, to dispense and administer the holy things of his house,</hi> according to his own will, prescribing an <hi>order</hi> to that end: the <hi>keyes</hi> being an <hi>ensigne</hi> of <hi>this power,</hi> and put by a <hi>meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy</hi> for the <hi>subject,</hi> the power it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is meant by the <hi>Catholick and visible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I had read over Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> once and again, I was at a stand in mine own thoughts, to determine certainly what was his proper intendment. I professe in a word of truth, I would not willingly misconceive his meaning, and so wrong him and the truth, but the variety of his expressions forced my apprehensions also to vary; <hi>sometime</hi> his words seem to cast this <hi>Catholick visible Church,</hi> upon the generall <hi>nature of a Church,</hi> or a <hi>Congregation</hi> taken in the <hi>common nature</hi> thereof; and this I could willingly embrace. Thus many of his phrases seem to sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To what principall subject hath the Lord given reason and a faculty of discoursing? <hi>is it to</hi> Peter or John? No, no: It is for and to the race of mankind: the case is so here, l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>2. 91. So speaking again of the same matter.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>293.</hi> So he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by order of nature to his Church in generall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sometime <hi>againe his expressions seem to intimate an</hi> Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall councell, <hi>which is the</hi> Catholike Church representative, l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>304.</hi> It doth not follow: because the Catholick, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative, visible Church, is the first subject of the keeyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly sometimes</hi> his expressions seem to point out a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick visible Church,</hi> in the <hi>integrall nature</hi> thereof, as an <hi>integrum</hi> arising out of all the particular congregations as the members thereof. This kinde of difference his words intimate. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 311.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Generall councels are neither necessary to the being, nor to the well-being, but only to the best-being of the Catholike Church; <hi>here he apparantly distinguisheth a</hi> generall councell <hi>from the Catholick Church in this debate.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The like phrase is found. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 304. Which of these doth most suit with his meaning, I cannot (to speak ingenuously) peremptorily define. The law was old, <hi>Cum bonis bon√® agier o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet.</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:111062:107"/> I confesse my thoughts have enclined me most unto the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> as that he intended an <hi>Oecomenicall Councell,</hi> because when he comes to apply himselfe to some of the objections which are made, his usuall discourse in the full current runs that way. Though, if I might have had my secret desire, I could have wished he had intended the <hi>first:</hi> because therein we should come neer to an accord.</p>
               <p>That I may deal sincerely in regard of the truth, and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, in regard of so worthy and learned a man as Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi> I shall take leave to set down my apprehensions, such as they be, touching all these senses, thus explained; let the truth prevail, and the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>Taking the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in the <hi>first sense,</hi> as eyeing <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church in generall,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its that which suits in a great part with our opinion and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions: we shall therefore gather in upon the right explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this truth, by the conclusions following.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conclus. </seg>1</label> When we say <hi>a congregation of visible Saints covenanting to walk in the ordinances of the Gospel, is the prime and originall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the power of the keyes;</hi> I suppose it is obvious to common sense, that as we do not, so we <hi>cannot understand</hi> it of <hi>this or that individuall congregation,</hi> as though they only had it, or none but they, or as though they had it <hi>firstly,</hi> and all from them: this, I say is obvious even to envy it self. For what meaneth those cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of <hi>Independency,</hi> which are cast upon our persons and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if we should hold that one particular did depend upon another? And in that we maintain this as a truth, that every particular congregation hath <hi>equall</hi> power with another, and <hi>compleat</hi> power, <hi>taken with all his officers,</hi> to the exercise of all ordinances, we do by such an Assertion professe that this power is common to them all, and therefore cannot be proper to any, but only in the <hi>individuall</hi> and <hi>speciall</hi> determination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The issue is this then, <hi>That the power of the keyes belongs first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a congregation of covenanting beleevers, not as this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but because a congregation of such,</hi> and thus I do conceive <hi>(salvo meliori judicio)</hi> that of our Saviour is to be interpreted, <hi>I will build my Church,</hi> taking a <hi>visible congregation of visible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting beleevers,</hi> as that which is a <hi>patterne</hi> and a <hi>samplar,</hi> (as I may so speak,) which leaves an impression upon all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:111062:108"/> as <hi>common unto all,</hi> and is <hi>preserved in all:</hi> and it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall out, but there will be some or other particular, in which it will be preserved, as we shall speak afterward, when we come to the speciall scanning the place; and in this sense it is, the Lord Jesus never wants a <hi>visible Church,</hi> on earth, though <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> visible may, doth, and will fail, as we see by plentifull experience and proof out of the word, in those famous congregations of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conclus. </seg>2</label>
                  <hi>A Congregation of Covenanting visible Saints, being a GENVS to all the particular congregations, which are</hi> partes homogeneae <hi>or</hi> species <hi>thereof:</hi> hence it followes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That a congregation doth firstly communicate its whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to every particular Church,</hi> and with that all the power and priviledges that did appertain unto it, it doth equally and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently bestow upon them. As it is a received rule in reason. <hi>Genus est totum partibus essentiale.</hi> And therefore doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his whole nature firstly and equally to all his <hi>species,</hi> and all those properties that did appertain to his nature by it and with it, it conveyes to all of them indifferently.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And from this ground it is, <hi>That each congregation hath all Ecclesiastical power that is seated in the generall nature of the Church,</hi> each particular assembly hath as equally and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed to it, as any other, and can act all of it without the other. As this and that particular man, as <hi>Tho. John, Jeremy</hi> hath all the nature equally and compleatly communicated to them, and can put forth the operations of that nature fully of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and without the help of any other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (in this sense) <hi>is never to be seen, but in particular congregations, nor yet ever exerciseth its power and operations alone</hi> (or <hi>seorsim) but only in the severall Assemblyes,</hi> Genus nec existit, nec operatur nisi in speciebus. The nature of <hi>Animal</hi> is only to be seen <hi>in homine &amp; bruto. The nature of man it only acts, only exists, in particular men.</hi> Hence <hi>the nature of the Church Catholike,</hi> or generall, comes to <hi>be determined and confined to its particular, and being determined, it only acts in that: and is regulated by that particular in which it is, and to which it gives its constitution, together with the speciall or individuall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which it is.</hi> The old rule was.</p>
               <q>Genus cum forma constituit speciem.</q>
               <p>I will take leave to exemplify for the help of the meaner sort
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:111062:108"/> whose apprehensions meet not with these in their ordinary rode. This <hi>Corporation</hi> is a speciall kind of a Corporation: This man and woman are husband and wife, or their contract is a mariage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. Here <hi>Corporation</hi> taken in the generall nature for the body of a people combined in a civill way for civill ends; <hi>this generall nature,</hi> and whatever priviledges are so proper and peculiar, as that they cannot be separated there from, both the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all such priviledges are truly attributed to &amp; affirmed of <hi>this and that particular corporation</hi> as the generall of the speciall, and this generall comes to be determined and <hi>specificated,</hi> by the <hi>individuall and formall combining of this</hi> speciall company of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and <hi>that</hi> makes it <hi>this corporation.</hi> And that <hi>generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as it comes to be conveyed to this particular, <hi>is confined to and acted only</hi> by the power of that particular: so that though <hi>this corporation hath the generall nature which is common to all corporations, yet have they not power nor priviledge, but in their own place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that marriage contract,</hi> which is generall to all of that sort and condition, it comes to be <hi>determined</hi> by the <hi>particular contracting</hi> of these, added to the <hi>generall:</hi> whence it is evident, that beside a marriage covenant in the generall, there must come a particular contract betwixt this man and this woman: else they will never be man and wife; still the rule holds, <hi>Genus cum form√¢ constituit speciem.</hi> The generall nature of marriage contract, comes to be determined only in this particular, <hi>so that he is a husband only to this woman, this woman is wife only to this man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence by the way, the weaknesse and fallacy of that conceit will easily be discovered, <hi>That profession in the generall, should make a man a member of all particular Churches on earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence fifthly,</hi> From the first ground it followes,</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That each particular congregation is compleat and independent, for the exercise of all acts and dispensations belonging to a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Church,</hi> without any reference to any other congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because they are distinct <hi>species,</hi> which <hi>firstly</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>genus,</hi> and so of all those priviledges that equally, and indifferently appertain thereunto.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence again, the generall nature of a Church,</hi> as it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi> so the full good, in the full Latitude thereof, <hi>is promoted
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111062:109"/> and advanced, by the particular Congregations, which are the</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <hi>thereof;</hi> for this is a collection which naturally and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followes and flowes from hence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence <hi>a Classis</hi> (which ariseth from particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet not from all, but from some, and that from some members of particular congregations, sent out for counsell-sake, to consider what might be usefull in the behalf of the Churches) it <hi>can be mo</hi> species <hi>of a Church: for a particular Congregation is</hi> species specialissima, whence it comes, <hi>the nature of the Church in generall,</hi> and of the <hi>species in particular are compleat,</hi> without any such a <hi>Classis;</hi> and therefore <hi>all Church-power,</hi> and the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> thereof is <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> in point of Jurisdiction <hi>without it. And therefore Jurisdiction cannot be firstly there,</hi> because if the nature of a Church be compleat without it, then the power and Jurisdiction of Church-government is compleat without that, and not first in that.</p>
               <q>Upon these grounds thus laid and debated, we shall addresse an <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>all Master</hi> Rutherford <hi>his Arguments,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they fall under this conclusion in the sense former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explicated.</q>

                        <hi>First,</hi> he would have the Apostles to receive the Keyes in the name of the whole Catholick Ministeriall guides. Because they must stand in the place and roome of a single society, when they received that Commission, whose sins ye remit, shall be remitted.</q> Joh. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Apostle</hi> in that Commission were <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> persons, and were sent into all the world, to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospell, by an Apostolicall power, and <hi>in this sense they have no successors; nor</hi> did they <hi>stand</hi> in the <hi>roome</hi> of any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they did supply the roome of a <hi>single society,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>what society was it?</hi> Neither of <hi>Ruling</hi> Elders, nor of <hi>Teaching</hi> Elders. It must be a <hi>single society,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> relation they must undergo; what ever will be affirmed, will be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to his cause. For if they were in the roome of <hi>Teaching</hi> Elders, then <hi>Ruling</hi> Elders have by this Commission <hi>no right</hi> to the <hi>Keyes.</hi> If they supplyed the roome of <hi>Ruling</hi> onely, then the <hi>teaching</hi> Elders must <hi>claime nothing</hi> from hence.</p>
                  <p>Againe, I would willingly know, when they supplyed the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111062:109"/> roome of either of these, whether they supplyed the roome of <hi>all</hi> of them, or of <hi>some</hi> of them?

                  </p>
                  <p>Nay because they are <hi>first Elders</hi> in the <hi>particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> before they be in a <hi>Classis</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> and there <hi>succeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles as Rulers:</hi> then they may be, nay <hi>must</hi> be <hi>there,</hi> the <hi>first subject of the Keyes,</hi> because <hi>there</hi> they <hi>first</hi> succeed the Apostles in binding and loosing <hi>by officiall Preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it shall be said, the <hi>Apostles</hi> represent <hi>Elders, as</hi> they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned</hi> in an <hi>Oecumenicall councell.</hi> This belongs to <hi>some</hi> only: for <hi>all Elders</hi> never met in an <hi>Oecumenicall councell.</hi> Beside this is not <hi>proper</hi> to Elders, for <hi>brethren there</hi> meet also: whereas this relation the Apostle here supplyes must be <hi>common</hi> to all <hi>that single society,</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> to <hi>that</hi> single society, whose roome they sustaine.</p>
                  <p>The naked truth is, <hi>the Apostles here,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. are <hi>extraordinary</hi> men whom <hi>none succeed.</hi> And as they are <hi>ordinary Presbyters,</hi> or supplyed their place, <hi>so</hi> they supplyed the place <hi>of Deacons, Act.</hi> 6.1, 2. and had <hi>vertually,</hi> and so could exercise, the power of <hi>all Officers.</hi> And therefore lastly when they supply the place of Elders, this shewes what an Elder should do in his order, and according to his place, but whether <hi>he</hi> be the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of Church power, <hi>this</hi> evinceth not; but in <hi>no</hi> manner or measure evidenceth any thing touching the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Elders,</hi> or <hi>their power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Before we addresse a particular <hi>answer</hi> to the <hi>Arguments</hi> next ensuing, we must recollect some former considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Reader may carry them along as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe to steere by.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. The common nature of Church and Officers onely exists and works, and is preserved in the particulars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The compleate being and power of Churches or Elders
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:111062:110"/> in the full compasse and Latitude of both, thus existing, includes not onely the <hi>common,</hi> but <hi>the peculiar nature of the individuals together with the generall:</hi> And therefore if we look at them, as in consideration severed from their individuals, they onely exist in <hi>our understanding,</hi> whereas the <hi>reality</hi> of their <hi>natures</hi> onely exists in the <hi>particulars.</hi> There must be a <hi>particular combination of a people,</hi> beside a combination in generall, before the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat nature</hi> of a <hi>Corporation</hi> will be <hi>existing,</hi> or can be so conceived. The like may be said of other free contracts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence the Lord never sets up Churches or Officers, gives power to them, and requires the execution of power from them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord looks at the <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>generall</hi> &amp; the generall as <hi>determined</hi> in <hi>the particular:</hi> The <hi>Reason</hi> is, because the <hi>existing</hi> and <hi>working</hi> of Churches and Officers is <hi>only</hi> to be seen, as it only appears, &amp; is expressed in the <hi>individuals.</hi> As when God makes an <hi>Officer</hi> by election, erects a <hi>Church,</hi> its a <hi>particular Church</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall Officer;</hi> therefore the individuall <hi>there</hi> first exists, and the <hi>generall</hi> in the <hi>individuall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence lastly upon the same ground, and for the same reason, as the generall is divided into his particulars, so the <hi>generals are preserved in them.</hi> All <hi>visible members exist in particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and are perfected by Ordinances therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Reader take these particulars with him, and they will pilot him so, as he may see his passage through all <hi>Objections</hi> that shall be presented in his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second and fourth Objections are these.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I pray you consider, that Christs intention, in giving the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, is not for a Congregation of <hi>40, 50, 100,</hi> as if he intended to impawne all power therein, but intended the edifying of his body Catholike, and the comming of all to the unity of the Faith. A Congregation cannot be all Saints. This power is cleerely given that body, which the Lord is to make a perfect man, according to the measure of the fulnesse of Christ, Lib. <hi>2.290.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sum of this is repeated, as the <hi>fourth</hi> Argument, 2. <hi>p.</hi> 293.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To that Church hath Christ given, as to the first Church the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Ministery which he principally intended to perfect, to gather, and to bring to the unity of the Faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But he principally intended to perfect, to gather, and to bring to the unity of the Faith in a perfect body, by these ordinances and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:111062:110"/> Ministery, the whole Catholike visible Church: and secondly this or that Congregation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> shall answer M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 248. Where he professedly disputes out of this place of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. for a Church invisible to be the <hi>first subject</hi> of all ordinances, Christian priviledges, and Officers, on this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence let me reason</hi> thus, (saith he)</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Church whose gathering together, whose unity of Faith &amp;c. and growth of that measure of the fulnesse of Christ, that the Lord intendeth, by giving to them for that end, some Pastors and Teachers: <hi>Eph. 4.11.12.</hi> must be that Church to whom all the promises of the Covenant and priviledges do belong.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But the Lord intendeth the gathering together to the unity of the Faith, to the knowledge of the sons of God, and growth of the measure of the fulnesse of Christ, only of the <hi>invisible, elected, and redeemed Chuhch,</hi> not of the <hi>visible, professing Church,</hi> nor doth the Lord send Pastors or Doctors, <hi>upon</hi> a purpose of gathering the <hi>Visible</hi> Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> is of several apprehensions, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines another; and upon the former grant this cannot stand, much lesse conclude.</p>
                  <p>Come we a little neerer to the marke, and try the particulars.</p>
                  <p>First examine the <hi>Proposition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those whom Christ doth purpose to bring <hi>to the unity of the Faith, and the fulnes of the stature of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4.11, 12. those are certainly such who shalbe saved. And therfore must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be <hi>true beleevers.</hi> For they alone attaine the <hi>perfection</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And it is as undeniably evident, that <hi>ordinances and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are not given firstly to such,</hi> I meane to <hi>true beleevers,</hi> as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> is expresse in severall passages of his book. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of salvation from God, and the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ving of Ordinances and Ministery keep not equall pace each with other; nay Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> will tell us, that <hi>such an opinion sides apparantly with the Arminians,</hi> L. 2. P. 248. The <hi>proposition then is utterly untrue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Assumption</hi> come to its tryall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But God doth principally intend to bring the whole Catholike visible Church to the unity of the Faith, the acknowledgement of the Son of God, and the fulnesse of the measure of the stature of Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:111062:111"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>whole visible Church consists of good and bad, wheat</hi> and <hi>tares,</hi> elect and reprobate, as it is confessed by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and by all judicious men.</p>
                  <p>And doth God intend to bring <hi>reprobates</hi> to <hi>the unity of the Faith</hi> and the <hi>fulnesse of the stature in Christ?</hi> I know that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> will not say so, so that both the premises failing, the conclusion must needs fall with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Secondly, what is all this to the controversy in hand? The question between M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> and us, is this; <hi>That to the Ministery and guides of the Catholike visible Church, the Lord hath committed the Keyes, as to the first subject:</hi> But let the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conclusion, and the whole frame of the reason be granted, to wit, that <hi>Ordinances and Ministery are given to the Catholike visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of beleevers</hi> (for these must here be understood, as being distinct from Ministers and guides) yet this proves not the <hi>Keyes given to the guides onely.</hi> For the former we can grant in a safe sense according to our former explications, and yet we shall deny this latter, as not finding any sufficient proofe for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. <hi>Lastly,</hi> apply we the Argument to that cause and question in hand, as controverted betwixt us, and it will appear that it fights strongly against it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To</hi> that Church <hi>which Christ principally intends to bring to the unity of the Faith and the acknowledgement of the Son of God, is</hi> to them <hi>gives the power of the Keyes, as to the first subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the gathering of the</hi> Ministery <hi>of the Catholike Church, the perfecting of them, and bringing of them to the unity of the Faith, and the acknowledgement of the Son of God, Christ doth not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore unto</hi> them <hi>are not the Keyes given as to the first subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we have done with the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>fourth Arguments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <q>If all power Ministeriall be given to a Congregation (by our brethrens confession) under the name of a flock of redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones, as the body of Christ, <hi>Act. 20.28. Col. 1.18.</hi> Then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Catholicke Church. For of them these titles are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and agree first to the Catholike visible Church, as is cleere <hi>Col. 1.18. Eph. 5 25, 26. 1 Tim. 3.15. Eph. 2.19, 20, 21.</hi> And so they come to our hand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:111062:111"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I am glad we are come so neer, if indeed it be so: why do we not then shake hands? for that is it which we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and earnestly desire, If it was that will and good pleasure of God. Let us then enquire whether Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his mind and our meaning agree, and then we shall most willingly fall in with him.</p>
                  <p>This Catholike Church, as before admits of a threefold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension: either as it implyes a <hi>covenanting congregation</hi> of beleevers: or 2. <hi>Totum representativum?</hi> 3. or <hi>Totum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grale.</hi> If he means the first, as it is the meaning of the Scripture, we have what we would, and Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his conclusion fals flat to the ground.</p>
                  <p>If the Catholick Church hath the power of the Keyes given firstly to it, then the Ministers and Guides thereof, are not the first subject of them.</p>
                  <p>But the Catholick Church <hi>i. e.</hi> according to us, A congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints covenanting (as before we have explicated the question) hath the power of the Keyes, therefore the Ministers or Guides are not the first subject:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> admits no gain-saying, because the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church and the Guides are different and distinct in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon apprehension,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second part</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> grants to wit, <hi>That the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall power of the</hi> Keyes, <hi>is given to a congregation, under the name of the flock, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence his cause must needs suffer shiprack, sailing by these sholes, for I suppose as Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> must as he doth, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Church-catholick</hi> as the spouse and body of Christ, and the <hi>Ministery</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>But here he grants, that this power is given to the spouse and body. Therefore not firstly to the ministery. Beside, the places which he alledgeth, and seems to allow, evince thus much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> sends for the elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and bids them take heed to the <hi>flock, over whom Christ hath made them overseers,</hi> therefore this <hi>flock</hi> is distinct from their <hi>overseers;</hi> and if unto such a <hi>flock</hi> the power ministeriall be given, it cannot be given to the <hi>overseers</hi> firstly.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>flock</hi> is not the Catholick Church, take it as an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum</hi> of all congregations, for its only at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and over it, not over all the world, where they made them <hi>overseers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:111062:112"/>
                  <p>Nor can it be meant of an Oecumenicall Church, upon the same grounds; yea by his own confession else-where, it is not so to be taken. Taking Catholick in this sense, according to former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>generall nature of a Church, as existing and acting in the particulars,</hi> we have what we desire, and our cause is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by this meanes, nor confuted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>That which is added, p. 291. 292. addes no force to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, nor hurt to our cause; namely its said,</hi> The whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church visible, is made one visible ministeriall body, and said to have organicall parts, as it is described, <hi>Cant. 6.4.</hi> by eyes, teeth, temple, and so to have particular Churches under her.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> All this is true, in a true sense, and urgeth not the conclusion at all. For the <hi>generall nature</hi> of officers, is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the <hi>generall nature of the Church,</hi> I mean it is of the like latitude. And conceive all particular congregations so constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they may be called <hi>unum genere, i. e.</hi> they all, are <hi>Church so</hi> gathered and <hi>constituted.</hi> This particular Church is a Church, and so all the particulars they have the nature of a Church attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them, and affirmed of them, as the <hi>genus</hi> of the <hi>species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus the nature of the Church, and so the power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> in the Church, take them compleated in their full being, they include the particular in the general, and determine the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in the particular: and so the nature of the Church and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes, exist firstly in the particular, are therein acted and in that determined, which is all we call for, and our cause requires in the explication of it. So that we are to seek neither for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church, nor the power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> acting or exsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>in particular congregation:</hi> As the <hi>genus</hi> only exists, acts, and is seen in his <hi>species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>seventh</hi> arguments belong to another place, where we shall attend them. The sixt is little or no whit differing from the third, yet we shall propound it, and make a returne unto it.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 6. <q>Because Christ hath not given the power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, ordinances, and jurisdiction to the single congregation, as to the first subject, upon <hi>the ground</hi> that our brethren speak, to wit, <hi>because</hi> the single congregation is that spouse, to which Christ is referred as an husband, and that body to which he carrieth the relation of a head.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:111062:112"/>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nor is it that adaequate number of ransomed persons, of sheep, of lost ones, to the which Christ doth carry that adaequate and compleat relation of a Saviour, King, Governour; therefore that visible Church, for whose salvation Christ hath given the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power, must be the larger visible Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Reader be pleased to look back to the first conclusion, in the explication of the cause, or the preparation we made to the Answer of the second Argument, it will appear that as we do not, so we cannot understand our question of the <hi>first</hi> subject of the <hi>Keyes</hi> to be <hi>an individuall or single congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> as though that individuall had it firstly and all from it: when the clamour of <hi>independency</hi> doth proclaime the contrary. How can we maintaine every <hi>individuall</hi> congregation to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,</hi> if one did depend upon another? whereas its well known, that we <hi>maintain each congregation hath equall power with another;</hi> therefore we say that the power of the Keyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>a congregation,</hi> as <hi>existing in its particulars,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>equally</hi> belongs to all particulars, in all which the <hi>generall</hi> with the <hi>particulars</hi> are <hi>preserved and perfected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>compleat being</hi> of a Church attended, as in Scripture phrase we find it, and as it suits with the rules of reason, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the <hi>particular in the generall,</hi> and the <hi>generall</hi> comes to be determined in the <hi>particular;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Tenet</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> propounds, is not that which we maintaine, but that which he is pleased to make to himselfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have thus dispatched the first member of the Controversie, touching the first subject of Church-power, or the power of the Keyes, namely, it doth <hi>not</hi> appertaine to <hi>the Gides</hi> of the visible Church, Take it as <hi>Totum genericum,</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versale.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Let us now consider it, as <hi>Totum representativum,</hi> i. e. as the Catholick visible Church is, represented in the <hi>Convention</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:111062:113"/> and <hi>assembling</hi> of the <hi>Pastors</hi> of all <hi>severall</hi> congregations, in a <hi>generall</hi> or <hi>oecumenicall councell.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>And according to this acception of a <hi>Catholick visible Church,</hi> the whole course and current of Master <hi>Rutherfords</hi> dispute in the severall answers and explications that are returned to Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propounded, is to be understood. The words are faire and full <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 305. <hi>The power of the keyes, by order of nature is onely in the Catholick representative Church, as in the first subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the pinch of the debate, we will look about us a little, that we may see where the way lyes. For the path to these generall councels hath beene so long disused, that its almost growne out of sight, and as he sometimes speaks in a like case, <hi>The high wayes are unoccupied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember then we must, There be <hi>two</hi> things, wherein the <hi>qualification</hi> and so the <hi>commission</hi> and warrant <hi>of a member of a councell</hi> consists especially. The <hi>materiall</hi> ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at Assemblies, is their <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>fitnes.</hi> The <hi>formall</hi> ground is, the <hi>Church-calling,</hi> and sending them. <hi>Parker de Polit.</hi> l. 3. c. 18. <hi>Materiale ex donis internis pendet, formale ex deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatione ecclesiae,</hi> and this Assertion is approved by Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and confessed by all ours, that I met withall, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 213.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Churches</hi> may send, and if they will follow the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in the word, they <hi>must</hi> send <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>holy men</hi> unto Synods, <hi>besides Pastors, Teachers, Elders;</hi> so <hi>Luke</hi> hath it <hi>Act.</hi> 15.25,<note place="margin">De concil. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. <hi>3.</hi> q c. sec. nestr.</note> 26. and therefore its an Argument <hi>which</hi> learned <hi>Whitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> alledgeth, from the nature of a Synod: That since a generall councell doth represent, <hi>universam ecclesiam,</hi> there should be <hi>some of all sorts and orders of men</hi> sent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: <hi>As Pastors, Doctors, Elders, Brethren,</hi> who should as it were <hi>personate,</hi> and supply the place of <hi>the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All these</hi> so sent and assembled in the Councell, have a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive and definitive sentence</hi> in the acts that shall be made, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> and <hi>determinations</hi> that shall passe. <hi>This</hi> is made the <hi>hinge</hi> and the very <hi>casting difference of the controversie</hi> betwixt <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> whereby our men vindicate the liberty and power of <hi>the brethren</hi> met in councell, against the usurpation of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Proctors,</hi> whereby they would arrogate and mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize all authority of deciding and determining controversies
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:111062:113"/> unto the <hi>Prelates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vbi supra contr. <hi>2.</hi> q, <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would carve out all the authority to that crew and company, and says, <hi>Apostolos judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse, Presbyteros consultasse, plebem audivisse tantum.</hi> But <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> states the question, as the common received judgement of all the orthodox, and so maintains that which is openly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the Popish conceit. <hi>Nostra vero haec sententia est, non solos praelatos habere jus definiendi in conciliis, sed homines quos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis idoneos eligi posse, qui ad concilium mittantur, eosque liber√© pronuntiare debere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence this Representative body is but a part, as it</hi> stands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <hi>to the Catholick visible Church,</hi> and therefore it is said, <hi>not to be a Totum</hi> in that relation, but <hi>representare totum,</hi> by way of <hi>delegation</hi> or <hi>commission</hi> given <hi>eo nomine,</hi> or in that respect. The acts of this company carry a kind of proportion and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the body which it represents: that what they in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their delegation do, its all one or the like reason, as if the body represented did it. Look at them, as they are now assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they are an entire body resulting out of the concurrence of all the severall members so concurring.</p>
               <p>We see now what the <hi>nature of this representative body</hi> is: we shall now draw neerer to the marke, and make <hi>application of this</hi> to the particular in hand. Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> expresseth the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in these termes <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.289. <q>To this Church universall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hath the Lord given a Ministery, and all his Ordinances of Word and Sacraments principally and primarily. And to the Ministery and guides of this Catholike visible Church hath the Lord commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Keyes, as to the first subject.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But we shall look off from this place, and take those words which are most plaine, as the bottome of our debate, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 305. <hi>The power of the Keyes, by order of nature is only in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike "representative Church, as in the first subject.</hi> From Pag. 300 to 309. And the scope of all his answer in the most candid and faire construction that can be made of them, looks this way.</p>
               <p>Againe, by <hi>power of the Keyes,</hi> we understand all the power of <hi>Ordination, excommunication,</hi> &amp;c. Which in the current and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon apprehension is comprehended therein.</p>
               <p>And the reasons which yet carry and cast the ballance to the <hi>negative part,</hi> and our apprehensions for the present that way, <hi>are these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:111062:114"/>1. We shall attend Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>owne explication,</hi> as that which he must take for granted and good, as admitting no just exception, namely,
<q>Quicquid convenit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> convenit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It <hi>must agree to all and only to that kind.</hi> Whence the Argument growes on, thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which firstly and onely belongs to the Catholike representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, that neither was, nor can be before it.</hi> The very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the termes gives in testimony undenyable unto this. For it cannot belong to <hi>it onely,</hi> if it belong <hi>to others beside it:</hi> nor to it <hi>firstly,</hi> if to others <hi>before it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the power of the Keyes was before the representative Church,</hi> yea before it had any being. For the Churches had the Keyes and the exercise of them by the space of 300 yeares, after our Saviour, when as yet there was not the name of an <hi>Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call councell</hi> heard of in the world.</p>
               <p>Beside, from the <hi>former grounds</hi> agreed on, touching the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of a generall councell, its plaine: That the <hi>Churches dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> all, both <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>power</hi> from themselves to the making up of such a generall Assembly. <hi>And therefore they had all Officers, and they</hi> the exercise of their Office-power <hi>before</hi> that day long.</p>
               <p>Nor will that distinction relieve the cause in this distresse, to wit, that <hi>in order of nature</hi> they are onely firstly in the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, but <hi>in order of time</hi> they are before in other subjects; nay the medicine makes the cause worse, though it was sicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>For that a proper quality should be in time before his proper subject, which gives it its being:</hi> and that it should be, <hi>in time before its owne nature, wherein his being lies,</hi> is beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of all the rules of reason. Beside, that severall things being <hi>compared</hi> together, one might be before another in nature, when it was <hi>simul</hi> and together with another in time, hath beene usually said, (and yet by some usually questioned, <hi>in that time ever attends nature</hi>) but that the <hi>same</hi> things should be <hi>in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> its <hi>nature</hi> had any being (as this distinction would bear us in hand) I suppose is unheard of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the power of the keyes should be given to an Oecumenicall councell as to the first subject: Then those should have and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise the power of the keyes, who were no Pastors nor officers in those acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that is denied by master Rutherford, ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:111062:114"/>
               <p>The proposition is proved, because the decrees and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the councell and their actings, in their decisions and definings are <hi>no proper works of a Pastor,</hi> &amp; nor doe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from these offices <hi>or officers</hi> as such. Thus Judicious <hi>Ames. Bell.</hi> enerv. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>de concil. p</hi> 10. Definire in <hi>conciliis generalibus non potest esse pars muneris Pastorum, quia tum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor nullus ecclesiae Primitivae, et pauci tant√πm sequentium saeculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum munus pastorale potuissent implere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ground is sure and safe. <hi>Acts which are common to Brethren, as well as to such as be officers, Those are not proper, nor doe proceed from an office or officer as such,</hi> but from some root or respect which doth indifferently belong unto both, as its evident in the case in hand, because they <hi>all act as messengers:</hi> for <hi>that</hi> as we heard even now, gave the <hi>formality</hi> to the member of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and by power and warrant of this proceeding issued from thence.</p>
               <p>Beside we heard before, that the councell consists of <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> as well as Elders, and the power of determining and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing issues joyntly from all, and to maintaine the contrary is judged an open point of Popery by Doctor <hi>whitaker.

                  <p>And hence there can <hi>no power of the keyes (as ordination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi> &amp;c.) be put forth but by <hi>the vertue</hi> of an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall <hi>councell</hi> giving in their influence first to that work: which is contrary to the evidence of scripture, and the experience of all ages.</p>
                  <p>And before I leave this argument I shall take leave to make some <hi>inferences</hi> from it, such as necessarily follow from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the thing according to the practise of all Arts, proceeding from the unfallible evidence of like precepts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence</hi> this <hi>is as necessary to the well-being of the Church as the power of the keyes,</hi> because the Churches have not this power but from hence. <hi>Hence, this representative Church is necessary to the</hi> bene esse <hi>of a Church,</hi> not onely <hi>ad melius et optimum esse.</hi> For it is as necessary as the power of the keyes: but that is necessary <hi>ad bene esse,</hi> by Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his confession. <hi>Hence this power of the keyes is here most perfectly;</hi> because here <hi>firstly. Hence most constantly and ordinarily?</hi> If <hi>firstly, onely,</hi> and <hi>alwayes</hi> here, and in others <hi>by vertue</hi> of this, then it is here most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and most ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>All these follow undeniably from the rule <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>To the Ministery and guides</hi> of <hi>that</hi> Catholike visible Church <hi>hath Christ committed the Keyes, as to the first subject, unto which he hath given his word, ordinances, Sacraments, Ministery primarily.</hi> This proposition is in terminis expressed and affirmed by Master <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi> nay determined as a conclusion beyond all gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> (I assume) <hi>to an Oecumenicall councell, as the</hi> Totum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentativum <hi>of all Churches, God hath not primarily, given to his Ministery, word, Sacraments, ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore an Oecumenicall representative Church hath not the keyes given to it, as to the first subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> (which onely needs proofe) sense and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the nature of the thing, Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his confession in cases paralell and of like nature doth abundantly confirme. For its well known to every man, that after the <hi>Ascension</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by the space of 300 yeeres, there was <hi>no generall councell</hi> in the world, were there neither Ministers sent, word not Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dispenced, <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> executing their office, performing the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ties of their places and charges, all that while to those, to whom, and for whose good, they were <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>primarily</hi> appointed?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Each man knowes, that the councell consists <hi>principally</hi> of those, who are <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in other Churches, and will a mans sense suffer him to say, that there must be <hi>Ministers</hi> sent to, <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>feed,</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> over <hi>these Ministers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay doth not the examples and records of all ages evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the preaching of the <hi>Word, administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> &amp;c. nor <hi>primarily</hi> nor <hi>secondarily</hi> is here attended? but <hi>the scanning of controversies, deciding</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> of doubtfull questions.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:111062:116"/>
                  <p>And lastly when Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> denyeth <hi>Ministers</hi> to have a <hi>Pastorall</hi> charge and <hi>watch</hi> over a <hi>Presbyteriall Church:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that watch onely is appropriate to the particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, the care of whose soules they stand charged withall: <hi>By parity of reason.</hi> he will in no case impose this upon any Pastor, to be a constant watchman over a generall councell: not only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its more then he can discharge, beside his care of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flock, but also, because it would seeme irrationall, that there should be a <hi>Pastor,</hi> and so a Ruler <hi>over those,</hi> whom he makes to have <hi>supreme rule over all Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hither appertains the <hi>seventh</hi> Argument of Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> touching <hi>the keyes</hi> given to the <hi>Catholike visible church:</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I <hi>formerly reserved it for this place,</hi> and shall now take it into scanning and consideration, and it is this, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 295.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When any scandalous person is delivered to Satan, he is cast out of the whole Catholike Church, therefore he was before his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a member of the whole Catholike Church. For he cannot be cast out, who was never within, and when he is excommunicated, his sins bound, as in heaven, so <hi>on earth, i. e.</hi> not onely in that tract of ground, where a handfull of a little congregation independent <hi>(as they say)</hi> of <hi>10,</hi> or <hi>20,</hi> or <hi>100</hi> doth ordinarily feed, but in all the visible world, where God hath a Church, and all, both within the little congregation and without, are to repute him as an hear then and a publican.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> When we enquired touching <hi>that</hi> which gave <hi>formallity</hi> to a <hi>member of a Church</hi> or congregation, we then at large deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the question, namly, That <hi>visible profession did not make a man a member of a congregation, much lesse a member of all the particular congregations on earth,</hi> whether we refer the <hi>Reader.</hi> Only, we infer from that which was then proved, that he who was not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>of all</hi> Churches, he cannot be said to be cut off <hi>from all</hi> because he <hi>never was</hi> ingrafted into them: no more then a member of one <hi>individuall man,</hi> being cut off from his body or person can be said to be cut <hi>off from another,</hi> because these two men have the nature of man common to them both: or more plainely; because a member of one Corporation is dis-franchised and condemned to perpetuall imprisonment, as Traytor, therefore all other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations should dis-franchise him also, because these two are <hi>species of a Corporation</hi> in generall.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:111062:116"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>True it is,</hi> when one Church of Christ hath righteously cast out a man, <hi>All other congregations should account of him as such an out cast, approve of the sentence of the Church,</hi> unlesse any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the contrary, and they should <hi>so</hi> expresse themselves, towards him, <hi>as such</hi> a one, whom the <hi>Lord Christ hath sentenced and judged as a heathen:</hi> and therefore becomes all, who are the <hi>subjects</hi> of Christ <hi>to judge so of</hi> him. As all <hi>the subjects</hi> of he <hi>Kingdome</hi> do account him a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and carry themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as such a one, who is convinced and <hi>proceeded</hi> against, as such, <hi>in one City</hi> or <hi>Corporation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ayme of that <hi>answer</hi> which Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, from <hi>some,</hi> who say, That the party is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated onely out of <hi>that</hi> Congregation, whereof he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>antecedenter;</hi> because Christ hath given the power <hi>of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> only to the Church: But he is excommunicated to all other Churches onely <hi>consequenter,</hi> by <hi>consequent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> sayes; <q>I answer the plain contrary. He is <hi>antecedenter</hi> and formally delivered to Satan by the power of the Catholike visible Church, which is put forth in exercises and acts, before that Church, whereof he is the neerest member.</q>
                     <q>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the left hand doth cut off the finger of the right hand, which otherwise should infect the whole body. Now it is not the left hand onely that cutteth off the contagious and infectious finger, but the whole man. Deliberate reason and the will consenteth it should be done, for the preservation of the whole. The left hand is a meere instrument, and the losse of the finger, is a losse to the whole body: and the finger is cut off the right hand not <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter</hi> onely, by the power of the left hand, but by the intrinsecall power that was in the whole body.</q>
                     <q>Its true the contagion should creep through and infect the right hand first: and therefore incision is made upon the right hand first. When the Eldership of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation delivers to Satan, it is not done by that power, that is intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall in the congregation onely, but by the power intrinsecall, that is in the whole universall Church. <hi>lib. 2. pag. 296.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We shall here pause a little, and as travellers use to do, view the coast how it lyes, because the path seemes dark, and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage somewhat hazardfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Answer</hi> then, If the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> put forth a power <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall</hi> in the excommunicating of the offender and delivering him to Satan, (as it is here said:) It must be either an <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:111062:117"/> councell,</hi> or a representative body of all, that must do this; or else <hi>all the Churches</hi> must have a hand in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>Oecumenik councell cannot excommunicate.</hi> For that which <hi>is not,</hi> hath no being, <hi>cannot</hi> put forth any <hi>operation. Non entis non est operatio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a <hi>generall councell was not</hi> after our Saviour by the space of 300 yeeres. There hath been none of late, by the space of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds, and when there will be any, no man knowes.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>therefore it can put forth no intrinsecall</hi> power in this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of excommunication, neither <hi>antecedenter,</hi> nor <hi>consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor <hi>can all the Churches</hi> be said, by any evidence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to have a hand, or put forth a power to this worke. For Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his own principles are, <hi>one congregation hath no power over another,</hi> one <hi>Classis</hi> over another, one <hi>Provinciall</hi> or <hi>Nationall</hi> councell, hath <hi>no power</hi> over another. Whence the <hi>inference</hi> is plaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They who have no power, much lesse supreme power over another, they can put forth no power over another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> (ex concessis) <hi>many Churches,</hi> Classis, Synods have <hi>no power over a congregation</hi> therefore they can put forth no power, much lesse <hi>antecedenter</hi> to this work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Againe,</hi> they who put forth a power <hi>intrinsecall</hi> to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, they must do it according <hi>to Christ his rule,</hi> and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to order prescribed by him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>in cases of excommunication,</hi> especially those of obstinacy, the <hi>rule</hi> of Christ, and the direction of the Gospell require, <hi>they should examine, convince, admonish, before excommunication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore they must be throughly <hi>informed</hi> and fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the offence, if they proceed <hi>regularly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>all the Curches cannot be thus informed with the offences of such,</hi> who are excommunicated, nor yet are <hi>bound</hi> to be, <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter, to</hi> the dispensation of the <hi>censure.</hi> They are not bound to receive all the complaints of every particular Church, to heare and examine all witnesses, not bound to convene the offending party, <hi>nor hath any Church but that, wherof he is a member, power to do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore according to the rule of Christ, <hi>they cannot put forth a power</hi> antecedenter to the excommunicating of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beside if <hi>all the</hi> Churches put forth a power <hi>antecedenter</hi> to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:111062:117"/> the excommunicating of the offender, before, the particular Church: <hi>then the sentence is known</hi> and past before the sentence of the particular congregation proceed: <hi>then there is no place left of Appeal to other Churches,</hi> because their judgement is past, therefore they need not require their judgement, but this Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> will in no wise allow, nor is it consistent with his principles nor indeed with reason.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>If after</hi> the excommunication past in a congregation or <hi>Classes,</hi> when <hi>other Classes, Synods,</hi> congregations shall come to be acquainted therewith, and the <hi>proceeding</hi> therein, as <hi>irregular</hi> and unjust, <hi>they shall reject the sentence,</hi> as not suitable to the mind of Christ, and protest against the proceeding; <hi>They who</hi> in their judgements ever <hi>disallowed the sentence,</hi> and by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour labour to repeale and oppose it; They <hi>cannot be said</hi> in reason <hi>to put forth an intrinsecall power,</hi> and that <hi>anteceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the execution of it.</p>
                  <p>And I suppose the Churches, who are of such a judgement would wonder to heare a congregation thus speake to them: Here is an offending Brother cast out of our society, for such obstinacy in evill: we have cast him out <hi>consequenter,</hi> but you have put forth an intrinsecall power <hi>antecedenter</hi> to our act, els it could never have beene done.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, if a Provinciall, nationall, Oecumenicall councell (that would condemn them for their sentence,) should heare them so speak, <hi>they would presently protest their innocency;</hi> and that they had no hand in it, they were never acquainted with their proceedings, for if they had, they should have professedly opposed them therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> if the whole Catholick Church <hi>put forth a power</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedenter <hi>in casting out every</hi> particular offender out of the Church: they also must needs put forth their power <hi>anteceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in receiving him in:</hi> which reason and the experience of all ages gainsayes. That a congregation should consult with all the Churches on earth, before they <hi>absolve</hi> a penitent offender: there was no such law delivered <hi>to the Church of Corinth</hi> in that case, but <hi>as</hi> he blames them, because they <hi>did not cast him</hi> out, before he wrote: so he wisheth them to <hi>receive</hi> him <hi>in againe</hi> into communion, neither staying nor expecting, untill <hi>a generall councell</hi> was called for that end.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>similitude</hi> which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> useth, hath a handsome
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111062:118"/>
                     <hi>colour to cousen the inconsiderate Reader,</hi> but being seriously weighed reacheth not the cause in hand.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>the left hand</hi> doth <hi>not only</hi> cut off the contagious and infectious finger, <hi>but the whole</hi> man. Deliberate reason and will consenteth thereunto; and the finger is cut off, not by the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>left hand</hi> onely, but by the <hi>intrinsecall</hi> power in the <hi>whole body.</hi> I say <hi>all this is true,</hi> and there is very good <hi>reason</hi> it should be so: because the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and so the whole hath <hi>full</hi> and <hi>sufficient power</hi> in it selfe, and that <hi>peculiarly</hi> and <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> appointed by God and nature to preserve it selfe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent infection in any member, and rather to cut of the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part, then that the contagion should spread to the ruine oi the whole.</p>
                  <p>And it is so exactly <hi>in particular congregation; the chief offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> as the <hi>mind and will</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> as the <hi>whole,</hi> have intrinsecall power given them by Christ, and should put it forth in his name, and according to his order to remove an infectious member. But how unsuitable is it to require the same of other Churches, because they excommunicate in the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature of a Church</hi> with them, when in truth they have no power over a particular Church, and therefore as they cannot, so they should not attempt any such thing? For to lay aside now the consideration of an independent congregation, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound only, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> his own <hi>principles for proof in this case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its confessed by Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> that a <hi>Church</hi> in an <hi>Island</hi> hath power of excommunication in her selfe: and therefore she may put it forth alone. And yet I suppose Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> will confesse, that a party so excommunicate is to be accounted a Heathen to all Churches as well, and as much, as any excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated out of a Church that hath neighbouring Churches near it: notwithstanding no other Churches have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can put forth no power, in the executing of that act of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication done by a Church in an <hi>Island.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same also may be said of <hi>Classes</hi> and <hi>provinciall Synods,</hi> in regard of <hi>other Synods and Classes,</hi> over whom they have no power, by his own grant, and yet a person excommunicated in one regularly, is so accounted of by all.</p>
                  <p>And common sense will constraine a mans judgement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:111062:118"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of one <hi>Corporation,</hi> must first be privy to the offence of any member in the Society, and then they have power to proceed against him, without either the power or privity of another corporation, though they be both members of the <hi>same Kingdome,</hi> and both <hi>species</hi> of a corporation, the common nature whereof is attributed to them both: because there is peculiar power left to them in their own place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts. The like may be said of a particular congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These grounds</hi> thus made good by reason, will give in evidence against <hi>severall expressions</hi> of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> as distant from the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That sister Churches receive members of other Churches to communion by an intrinsecall authoritative Church power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he mean <hi>such</hi> an <hi>authoritative Church-power,</hi> as a <hi>congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> puts forth <hi>in excommunication,</hi> such a power these should put forth in <hi>admittance</hi> to communion: Its an <hi>Assertion</hi> neither safe nor sound, and a mans experience will teach him the contrary: For by authoritative Church-power we can enjoine our own members <hi>to come</hi> to the seale, or else <hi>censure them,</hi> but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so deale with others, if it shall seem good to them to refuse to come.</p>
                  <p>He addes, <q>Christ hath given an intrinsecall power to many consociated Churches to cast out a contagious lump, otherwise the consociated Churches are to exercise the punishment, of the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excommunicated person, as an Heathen, which followeth from a power which is no wayes in them; what conscience is here?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Answ.</hi> A good conscience rightly guided by rule; For <hi>if by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Law</hi> speaks: then much more shall a <hi>fact be established,</hi> that hath not the <hi>testimony</hi> of two or three, but of a <hi>whole Church,</hi> it may be so many hundreds to bear witnesse thereunto. And no man, nay no court in the world, can but yield to this evidence, before something appear to the contrary, unlesse against conscience they shall lay aside the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>Law</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>We shall propound a narrower case then this, and yet its so plaine that it will carry the judgement of any considerate man with it. Suppose a party going to some remote place, whether his occasion leads him, intends to joyne with the Church of Christ there set up: another person privy to his intention, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:111062:119"/> knowing the man undeserving, he gives intimation to a friend under his <hi>own</hi> hand <hi>and two others,</hi> that the party is scandalous for oppression and cousenage: when he shall desire entrance and acceptance, the letter is shewed, and witnesses discovered, and he justly denyed admittance, with is a just punishment justly inflicted upon him, and that which a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>In the case in hand, the argument forceth a <hi>fortiori.</hi> If we may account a man scandalous, and carry our selves towards him as such a one, under the witnesses of two or three, before the contrary be manifested: much more may we account a person just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicated and demeane our selves towards him in a manner suitable to such a condition under the testimony of a Church of Christ, untill something shall appeare to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But suppose the Church erre, and cast out the person Clave er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante? shall a man in a brutish manner practise according to their proceeding, and not discern whether the censure be justly or unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is not to practise after a bruitish manner, but to proceed according to <hi>such rules,</hi> better then which <hi>nor reason nor righteousnesse</hi> requires any: For under such a testimony the person stands justly excommunicated in mine account, and I must judge so if I will judge righteously. Jnstance. A person is accused in <hi>open Court of Treason</hi> upon <hi>three witnesses,</hi> which are pregnant and peremptory: The <hi>judge</hi> cannot but condemne the man, as such a malefactor; and in case he should make an escape, <hi>all that</hi> heare of the proceeding, they are to <hi>account him such</hi> a one, and to proceed against him as such, and yet cannot be said to practise <hi>brutishly,</hi> but <hi>piously</hi> and <hi>righteously,</hi> according to rules of reasonable nature, which God hath revealed in his holy word, untill the testimony given in be controlled and disannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; so it is here.</p>
                  <p>Lastly I shall present unto the <hi>Reader</hi> and to Master <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> what himselfe hath writ in another place, and so leave this argument. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 320. we find these words, the question being there propounded, since a scandalous person living betwixt two neighbouring presbyteries, and so likely to infect both equally and indefferently by his offence, why therefore should he not be cast out of both?</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his answer is this.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A man would think at the first blush, <hi>If one classicall Church doe not excommunicate antecedenter: by the same proportion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son many must not,</hi> nay none but his own classis doe excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him, and therefore how <hi>can the Catholike Church</hi> be said to doe this <hi>antecedenter?</hi> but Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> best knowes his owne meaning, and this will <hi>occasion</hi> him to explicate it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd to deale candidly in this as in the former course of our dispute, we professe our ayme in this inquiry is, onely to give in what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we can, to the clearer discovery of the Truth. For I cannot find any expressions in Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> that fully fasten this sense upon any passage of his dispute, and it is not in my thoughts to father any thing upon him, beside what he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expresseth.</p>
               <p>For our more cleere and direct proceeding, I shall take leave to inquire. 1. <hi>What is meant by a Catholike visible Church ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this sense, as</hi> Totum integrale.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether such a Church is to be found in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> hath some time such a respect, as <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> I now and then find amongst <hi>Authors. Ames Medull. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 32. <hi>par.</hi> 5.</p>
               <q>Ecclesia particularis respectu Ecclesiae Catholicae, quae habet rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem integri, est membrum.</q>
               <p>His meaning is, if we look at particular <hi>members</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:111062:120"/>
                  <hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>aggregated</hi> together, that which results and ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the confluence and concurrence of them all, we put the respect of <hi>Totum integrale</hi> upon it, and so it is called <hi>ecclesia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the right discerning of this, and differencing of some considerations about it, The Reader must take notice <hi>that three things</hi> are to be attended for the distinct understanding of this <hi>Totum,</hi> that he may sever it from former respects, unto which we have spoken and discerne <hi>the nature of it</hi> from the <hi>generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Church,</hi> between which there is an exceeding <hi>vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, the <hi>particular persons and Congregations,</hi> the members of this Church Catholike taken in this notion and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, containe in them the <hi>essentiall causes</hi> of it, out of which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth, and is constituted: Whereas <hi>Totum universale</hi> contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise containes and <hi>communicates</hi> causes to particular Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence,</hi> these particular persons and Churches are, and must be in <hi>nature</hi> before this <hi>Totum integrale</hi> i. e. This Catholike Church thus aggregated: and this followes from the former, in so much as the <hi>causes</hi> are in nature before the effect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence</hi> this <hi>totum</hi> in proper and precise consideration, though it be ever with its members, yet is <hi>distinct</hi> from them, as that which ariseth out of them. As <hi>a man</hi> is neither <hi>body</hi> nor <hi>soule,</hi> but an <hi>integrum,</hi> a <hi>third</hi> rising out of them <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>The Reader must carry these along with him, because hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall have recourse to them, as occasion shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</q>
               <p>The second things to be inquired, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether this Church is to be found in the New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this <hi>Quaere</hi> was presented unto Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> by way of Objection, thus, <hi>You cannot demonstrate out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there is such a thing in the New Testament as a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like visible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He answers in these words, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.418.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I conceive the subject of <hi>1 Cor. 12.</hi> is a Catholike visible Church; we do not understand a politicall visible body, with ordinary visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble government from one man, who maketh himselfe the Vicar of Christ, the Pope, whose members are Cardinals, Bishops, and such
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:111062:120"/> like, but the Catholike body mysticall of Christ, and that as visible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We see here Master <hi>Rutherf.</hi> his expressions presented before us; but what his meaning is, I confesse, I cannot cleerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as,
<list>
                     <item>1. What is the meaning of that <hi>phrase, mysticall as visible.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. What is the <hi>thing</hi> intended by it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not readily conceive his mind in such an expression; we understand the body <hi>mysticall</hi> of Christ as <hi>invisible.</hi> For the <hi>mysticall</hi> body of Christ, in common and current sense is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly taken for the <hi>invisible</hi> body of our Saviour. Now to consider an <hi>invisible</hi> body as <hi>visible</hi> doth <hi>implicate</hi> plainely; and is, as if a man should say, I will consider <hi>whitenesse</hi> as it is <hi>black,</hi> and therefore this seemes not to be his mind: but it may be he takes <hi>mysticall</hi> in another <hi>figurative</hi> meaning: or haply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is mis-printed. It sufficeth to point at it, to occasion further explication.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What</hi> is the <hi>thing</hi> here intended, is as hard to find out fully.</p>
               <p>When I observed that he puts <hi>visible</hi> in a kind of <hi>equal breadth</hi> and latitude with <hi>mysticall: That</hi> being <hi>Totum integrale</hi> of all the parts aggregated, I could not but imagine, his intendment was to take <hi>visible</hi> in the same sense. Beside <hi>Lib.</hi> 2 <hi>pag.</hi> 222. I find him distinguishing the <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>particular</hi> Congregations from the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, whereas had he taken Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like for <hi>universall,</hi> then the Pastors of one must be the Pastors of the other. For <hi>genus</hi> is only existing in its <hi>species,</hi> and there on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be seene, and so consequently attended.</p>
               <p>These are probabilities which sway my judgement <hi>that way.</hi> But I find also that sometimes he puts in the word <hi>universall</hi> to expresse his meaning of the place. And <hi>this casts the ballance the other</hi> way. So that I cannot say, he meaneth by Catholike Church visible, a <hi>totum integrale. And therefore I shall not oppose it as his sense, but onely dispute against it, as not the sense of the place; and that</hi> these <hi>Reasons</hi> following perswade me for the present.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That Church is meant in</hi> 1 Cor. 12. <hi>in which God sets Teachers, Helps, Governments as ordinary Officers firstly,</hi> vers. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he sets not these firstly in the Catholike Church visible, as</hi> totum aggregatum, (before explicated.)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption,</hi> where onely the doubt lies, is thus proved.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111062:121"/> Because the setting of the officers in the Church (I speak now of those which are ordinary) is by the <hi>Election of the people,</hi> and therefore this setting and officers set must be <hi>there, where</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is: this election or call being the foundation, whence the relation between Pastors and people results, and so become in relation one to another, gives mutuall being each to other, are together one with another.</p>

                     <hi>In what Church Pastors are firstly set, over them they have first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and primarily Pastorlike power</hi> in preaching, ruling, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing the acts of their office. The nature of the office, Gods charge and command, the end at which they must aim, and for which sent, evinceth this. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But ordinary Teachers hatve not this pastorall and officiall power over the Catholick Church,</hi> as will thus appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Those</hi> whose <hi>power</hi> by the Law and order of Christ may be <hi>refused in all</hi> congregations, <hi>but in their own</hi> particular; <hi>They</hi> by no law of Christ have right of pastorall power in any, <hi>but in their own particular charges</hi> and Churches; otherwise the Lord Christ should set a man in his office, and by rule and law others may for ever refuse the exercise and power of his office over whom he is set.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the power of ordinary Pastors may by law and order of Christ, be justly refused in all congregations beside their own.</hi> As suppose all congregations have Pastors of their own, they may justly refuse any to preach, or exercise any Jurisdiction amongst them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he that hath power to preach as a Pastor, he hath authority to enjoin those, who are his flock, to attend him, though they should refuse it: yea to exercise his office, though they do not desire it. For it is not read in any Gospell, that the Lord Christ hangs the performance of a Teachers office upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers desires, but upon his own duty, with which he stands char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with by vertue of his place.</p>
                  <p>For I might <hi>lastly</hi> here <hi>adde</hi> (though many other reasons are at hand, yet I will not multiply, because I know not Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> his minde in this behalfe, and I would not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:111062:121"/> without cause) I say, I may here adde; <hi>If a man be a Pastor to all Churches beside his own particular: Then he is either the same Pastor to both, or another and diverse.</hi> This last none will own; therefore he must be the same to both; and he that hath the same pastorall office, he hath the same power and jurisdiction in both, stands in the same manner bound to both, because right of Jurisdiction issues from his office-call.</p>
                  <p>These mists then being removed, the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Apostle is this; <hi>God hath set</hi> in his Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>a Congregation existing in its particulars,</hi> and so in all particular congregations, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ordinary officers, according to the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ordinary occasions thereof; and this sense suits with that, which we explicated in the first part of this dispute, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a Catholick visible Church</hi> as Totum universale; and hence that <hi>quaere</hi> which carries the only difficulty with it receives a full satisfaction, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 401.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This indefinite speech (<hi>sayes Mr.</hi> Rutherford) <hi>must</hi> by good logick have the vertue either of one universall, or a particular proposition: If they say the first, we have what we crave: if they say the second, they fall into the former absurdity, for God hath placed Apostles in the whole Christian world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> crave no more but this, that every particular congregation should be the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>a Congregation,</hi> we willingly grant him his desire: but to affirme, that the <hi>reason</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> of <hi>Totum aggregatum,</hi> is as far wide, as <hi>east</hi> is from the <hi>west.</hi> And that his cause gains nothing by this grant, is plain: for thus the nature of a Church exists only, acts only, is to be seen only in the particulars, doth equally and firstly communicate his nature to the particulars, so that no Church hath more power then another, nor yet power over another, having upon this ground and grant an <hi>independent</hi> power of its owne: As <hi>each species</hi> hath <hi>firstly and independently</hi> the nature of the <hi>genus,</hi> which so existing in it, comes to be confined to it, and wholly to be ordered by it. As we shall give in evidence, by instance of many particulars, that we may relieve the Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>common nature</hi> of a <hi>Corporation</hi> exists in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregations, and so its common to all to have <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Common-councell,</hi> (I speak <hi>ex supposito</hi>) which government and Governours existing in and determined by the particulars,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:111062:122"/> have only <hi>power</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> place: The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>councell</hi> can exercise <hi>no</hi> authority in <hi>another</hi> corporation. To reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus, if the nature of a corporation be common to all, and the King hath set Major and common-councell in all and every one of them, therefore the Major of one, may rule in another corporation; I say such an inference, will in no wise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>The like may be said of like example. All <hi>states set Generals, Colonels, Captains in their Armies:</hi> The king <hi>sets constables</hi> in <hi>all</hi> Towns; Sheriffes in all Countyes. If any shall reason thus, If this be common to all Towns to have Constables, Sheriffs in all Countyes; therefore a Constable may exercise his office in another Towne, or a Sheriffe in another County: each mans experience will give in evidence to the contrary. And the ground of the Argument taken from the community of the nature of such things, will not inforce it, but inferre the contrary, if seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously considered.</p>
                  <p>The sense of the Text thus opened, the <hi>Arguments</hi> gathered out of the severall verses will easily receive their answer: This then is the sense, as hath been proved <hi>A congregation</hi> or Church existing in his particulars is <hi>the Church here meant,</hi> and therefore all particular congregations are here intended.</p>
                  <p>And its true, that in all particular congregations (those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts and miracles being now ceased) there be the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> officers of <hi>Teachers, Helps, Governments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its true of all particular congregations, that they are one body in themselves, and are one in the common nature of the Church, and these take in all visibly baptized into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its true that in all these particular congregations all <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are comprehended, that come within the pale of the visible Church. For the whole nature of the generall exists in the particulars.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its true, that the members of each particular congregation have need each of other, and one particular Church of the help of another, as occasion shall require.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Its true of all particular congregations, that their members should not make a schisme one from another.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Its true of all particular congregations, that the members
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:111062:122"/> do and should especially care one for another, and suffer one with another.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Its true of all particular congregations, that by immediate commission God set Apostles, whose power of rule reacheth to them all, but ordinary officers he hath fixed to their particular places and stations, each one in the individuall congregation by the which he was called, and over whom he is appointed.</p>
                  <q>We have now done with our <hi>inquiry</hi> touching the <hi>Catholick visible Church:</hi> we shall <hi>remind</hi> the Reader of <hi>two</hi> things, which may be of speciall use, and so we shall put an end to this dispute.</q>

                     <p n="1">1. From the foregoing discourse he may discerne, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the opinion of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> appears, touching this Catholick visible Church, with any certainty. <q>
                           <hi>As namely,</hi> Its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> holds the power af the keyes belongs firstly to the Catholick Representative Church; <hi>for to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his words are most expresse.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>305.</hi> The power of the keyes by order of nature, is onely in the Catholick representative Church, as in the first subject.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its <hi>not</hi> to me <hi>certain,</hi> what he holds touching the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like visible Church, considered either as <hi>Totum universale,</hi> or <hi>Integrale:</hi> what probabilities his expressions carry either way, we have formerly intimated out of severall places: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it most faire, to fasten nothing upon him, unlesse his words were fully and conclusively clear.</p>
                     <p>Lastly its certain, <hi>that if</hi> the power of the keyes be <hi>in</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike <hi>representative</hi> Church, as the first subject, <hi>they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long firstly to the Catholick Church,</hi> either as <hi>Totum universale</hi> or <hi>integrale:</hi> The distance and difference betwixt these <hi>three</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former explication is so great and vast.</p>

                     <p>Againe let me remind the Reader, what light the truth hath gained, if we look at it, as laid forth in the right frame of it. As thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The common nature of a Church, and so the nature of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in that proportion, are only existing, acting, and become visible in the particulars, as their <hi>species.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence</hi> all officers and office-power, as the nature of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:111062:123"/> Church, so their nature, is equally, firstly, independently, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all particular congregations: so that they do not receive office nor office power, one particular from another, or more particulars, because all particulars share in all equally and firstly, as <hi>species</hi> pertake of the nature of a <hi>Genus.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> An Answer to Mr. <hi>Hudson,</hi> concerning the Church-Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as <hi>Totum integrale.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I was inquiring and writing touching this <hi>ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia catholica visibilis,</hi> an especiall providence brought a book to my view which did purposely intreate of this particular subject. The Author Master <hi>Hudson</hi> a learned man, and a faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>When I had considered his writing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> I found his judgement sharp and scholasticall, his spirit Christian and moderate, his expression succinct and pregantly plaine to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his owne apprehensions.</p>
               <p>So that my heart was much contented with the <hi>Acumen</hi> and Judicious diligence of the Author; though I could not consent to what he writ, yet I could not but unfainedly prise the learning, perspicuity and painfulnesse expressed in his writing.</p>
               <p>Therefore I thought good to cast in some few <hi>considerations</hi> touching the things of greatest consequence therein, <hi>that so I</hi> might occasion him and others also, into whose hands that book may come, if not to judge otherwise, yet to consider againe of some particulars whether they will abide the balance of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is one principal point:</hi> I say, principals, because the whole frame of the dispute stayes upon that, as upon the maine pillar and foundation, which if it faile, the whole falls to the ground as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:111062:123"/> Master <hi>H.</hi> confesseth. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I finde <hi>(saith he)</hi> the subject of my question exceedingly opposed, <hi>and that</hi> by our divines; and therefore I must crave leav to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that sufficiently or els, what ever I shall say of the praedicate, will be as a house built upon the sand, or a castle in the aire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The grearest weight lies here, and therefore my greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry shalbe about the truth of this.</p>
               <p>And before I enter upon the examination of this principall point propounded, I shall <hi>collect severall expressions, out of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places in the writing,</hi> which I shall set downe as so many <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions confessed by the Author</hi> that my selfe and reader may have recourse thereunto, as occasion shall require in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, when their specials shall come to a Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>cious triall.</p>
               <p>And since Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> acknowledgeth, that this question is exceedingly opposed, and that by <hi>our Divines;</hi> I may say, by <hi>all the pious and Judicious Orthodox,</hi> that I meet withall, who write against the Papists, it will not seem strange to any, nor yet, I suppose, grievous to Mr. <hi>Hudson,</hi> if I joine with them in this defence of the truth, as I yet conceive it to be.</p>
               <p>And in my retired meditations, I could not but observe <hi>a secret Kind of divine dispensation</hi> that the <hi>Presbyterian way</hi> must <hi>need the helpe of a point of Popery,</hi> not onely as <hi>a pillar,</hi> by which it must be under propped, but as a <hi>foundation</hi> or <hi>head corner stone,</hi> upon which <hi>the whole building must rest and be erected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>grants</hi> and <hi>postulata</hi> which I shall mention, are thus freely and fully laid downe in severall passages and places.</p>

                  <p>I thus take leave to sever and sunder the specials one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, because if I deceive not my selfe much, they will make
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:111062:124"/> way, not onely for the help of the Reader, that he may more easily carry them along with him in his consideration, but also may readily have resort thereunto, as the occasion of the dispute shall require.</p>
                  <p>From these particulars thus premised, the STATE OF THE QUESTION is fully this,
<q>Whether there be a Catholike visible Church, as <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> consisting of all the particular Churches, as its members?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to this we must <hi>answer</hi> yet <hi>negatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because</hi> this <hi>question,</hi> thus propounded, lookes so fully like a <hi>Popish Tenent,</hi> at the first appearance, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> desires to put a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant dresse</hi> upon it, that persons might not suspect it came from the <hi>Romish Synagogue,</hi> by reason of the <hi>Pontifician Shibboleth</hi> it presents before the judicious Reader. And therefore he would difference <hi>this</hi> question from <hi>theirs</hi> in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Pontificians take <hi>visible</hi> for <hi>conspicuous</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They hold the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Church Catholike</hi> to belong <hi>to one</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They hold that this <hi>visible Catholike Church</hi> should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>one visible universall head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reply</hi> is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This salve onely skinnes over the sore,</hi> but neither heales the wound: nor removes the skarre. For it is certaine, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny collaterall errors, which go in the crowd and company with this Popish opinion; but with his favour, those which he hath mentioned with many others, <hi>they border about this cause,</hi> but <hi>enter not</hi> at all into the <hi>state</hi> and constitution of it, but are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct errors,</hi> so mentioned, so maintained by the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> so opposed by ours. For Mr. <hi>H.</hi> very well knowes, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> with the rest of the Popish champions, marshall <hi>these causes</hi> as distinct companies, when they come into the field.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ecclesia non potest deficere</hi> (i. e.) <hi>numerus eorum qui veram fidem profitentur, non est semper frequens &amp; gloriosus.</hi> And that is the state of that question controverted betwixt us and them. <hi>Whitaker de eccles. quest. tert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ecclesiae regimen est monarchicum: nempe opus est visibili monarcha &amp; summo judice.</hi> Whitak. de Rom. Pontif. q. 1. c. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its also a distinct question, That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> succeeds

                  <p>Hence its plaine that <hi>all</hi> the differences Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propounds, are so many <hi>distinct questions</hi> among the Pontificians, and <hi>that this [Ecclesia Catholica est visibilis]</hi> is <hi>a fourth distinct from all the three former.</hi> Therfore they <hi>enter not</hi> at all into the <hi>state</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>this,</hi> as either controverted with the Papists, or now agitated and disputed with us.</p>
                  <p>And if Mr. <hi>Huds.</hi> please to cast his eye upon the expressions and apprehensions of judicious <hi>Whitaker,</hi> when he debates the question, he will plainely and presently perceive, that <hi>visible</hi> here is opposed to <hi>invisible,</hi> by the confession of all our writers against the Papists: and when they prove that the Catholike Church is not visible, they do not meane, that it is <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> to the world, but that it <hi>never was, nor can be visible to any;</hi> but it is to be beleeved, not to be apprehended by sense.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And therefore the forenamed Author makes these two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct questions</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesia Catholica non est visibilis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesia visibilis potest deficere:</hi> i. e. <hi>ecclesia visibilis non est sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per frequens et gloriosa. vid. ub. supra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The issue then is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If these three mentioned differences be three distinct questions from this, now controverted; then they enter not into the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this:</hi> Take it in his peculiar and precise consideration and as controverted betwixt the Papists and us.</p>
                  <p>And if he will have recourse to learned <hi>Sadeel.</hi> he will there find, that <hi>Turrian</hi> so expresseth, so understands his meaning, that <hi>Ecclesia Catholica visibilis est aggregata ex omnibus particularibus ecclesiis, per totum terrarum orbem fusis:</hi> which is the very <hi>hinge</hi> of this <hi>question now</hi> controverted <hi>with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that I must yet crave leave to concurre with all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines against the Papists in this opinion, and to professe with them, that, <hi>Ecclesia Catholica est invisibilis:</hi> i. e. <hi>nec ab impio im√≤ ne a quoquam pio, videri potest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when we say that <hi>Ecclesia Catholica non est visibilis,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor I <hi>meane,</hi> that it is <hi>not conspicuous</hi> to the eye of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:111062:125"/> world: <hi>but</hi> that there is <hi>no such Ecclesia aggregata ex omnibus ecclesiis visibilibus,</hi> that hath <hi>any being in rerum natura,</hi> or was instituted by our Saviour Christ.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this <hi>conclusion,</hi> we shall first dispute from the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Totum integrale.</hi> For herein M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>H.</hi> deserves just commendation, that he deales openly, and like a judicious Divine, expresly intimates, what kind of <hi>Totum</hi> he meaneth, that so we may not be to seeke, when we should speak to the point contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and intended by him. <hi>Dolus latet in universalibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin then our inquiry touching the nature of <hi>Totum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grale,</hi> which being attended, according to the proper and right description of it, that will be as a <hi>torch in the entry,</hi> to give light, and lead the Reader into the particular truths, as so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular roomes in the house that so the whole frame may fully be conceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Integrum</hi> says (the <hi>Logician,) est totum, cui partes sunt, essentiales:</hi> it is <hi>such a whole, unto which the parts are essentials;</hi> i. e. give the essentiall causes, whence the integrity and entirenesse of the whole is made and constituted. And therefore to speak in their language, they are <hi>orta argumenta;</hi> the <hi>members arise</hi> out of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> and containe in them <hi>materialia &amp; formalia principia,</hi> which they give, in their concurrence to make up the <hi>integrum.</hi> Thus the severall Troopes and Companies make up the Army. The Free-men of so many Companies, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell of Aldermen, and Major make up a Corporation. So many Cities, Shires, Counties, make up a Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>In all these the <hi>members are causall,</hi> each gives in <hi>a substantiall share,</hi> to make up the <hi>integrity</hi> or <hi>intirenesse</hi> of the <hi>whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence,</hi> the members are in <hi>nature before the whole</hi> (I say in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because I would not run into needlesse niceties touching any other priority, but thus they are certainly before the whole) because they containe the causes that make it up.</p>
                  <p>That which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>H.</hi> suggests else where by way of <hi>objection,</hi> that they be <hi>relata,</hi> and therefore <hi>simul natur√¢,</hi> is an old fallacy fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Schooles, and proceeds meerely out of a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Logicall principles. True it is, that <hi>integrum</hi> and <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> may be cloathed with <hi>such a respect,</hi> which may be put upon them, for our expression and apprehension (as it were easie to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, onely it sutes not this popular debate) but to speak <hi>properly,</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:111062:126"/> look at <hi>integrum</hi> and <hi>membra</hi> in their peculiar <hi>affection of arguing,</hi> and they can be no more <hi>Relata,</hi> then one opposite can be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther..</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence,</hi> The <hi>integrum</hi> is <hi>another thing</hi> resulting and arising from the members imitating exactly the nature of the <hi>effect,</hi> existing from his causes, and therefore its called <hi>symbolum effecti.</hi> As a body is distinct and a third in reason and reality from all his members; The Army constituted of the severall Companies; The Kingdome from the severall Counties, Hundreds, Cities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence</hi> lastly, This is made peculiar to this <hi>Totum</hi> (from <hi>that</hi> we call <hi>Totum genericum,</hi> or <hi>universale,) That what belongs to this, doth not belong to all the members.</hi> As that man is said to eat, drink walke, talke, look upward, when no part of the body, nor yet the soule, in reason, or according to truth, can be said to doe any of these actions.</p>
                  <p>Hence then it followes undenyably and necessarily,</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> be <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> its <hi>a third,</hi> and <hi>distinct from all the members,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> from <hi>all</hi> particular Congregations. And therefore <hi>there must be some Officer, Act, and Ordinance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to that, which doth not appertain to any of the members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this <hi>rule,</hi> reason, all experiences, all instances in all <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grums,</hi> do evidence. There is a <hi>supreme</hi> governour in a <hi>kingdom.</hi> A <hi>Generall</hi> in a <hi>Camp,</hi> besides all other Officers in all the <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there could yet be never given any discovery of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, as a <hi>third</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> from its members, nor yet <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Officer,</hi> besides those which are observed and exercised in particular Churches.</p>
                  <p>And I would earnestly and seriously desire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any man living, but to lay forth the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>particular</hi> Congregations, and attend <hi>all</hi> the Offices, actions, and ordinances there dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in <hi>precise</hi> consideration, offer to my understanding, the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>whole distinct</hi> in apprehension (I would not, I desire not a separation of this whole from the parts, or the pulling of them a sunder, for that were <hi>insanire cum ratione</hi>) but a present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some <hi>distinct, Officer, Act,</hi> or <hi>operation, seclusa ratione,</hi> or not <hi>habit√¢ ratione</hi> of particular Congregations, which do not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them. And this must be done, or else this <hi>totum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grale</hi> will prove a meere <hi>fiction,</hi> and a conceit minted out of a mans imagination.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:111062:126"/>
                  <p>Its true, <hi>Totum genericum,</hi> or take the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Church in generall,</hi> there is nothing required, but that it should exist in its particulars, as in its species: and that the generall nature of a Church, and all the priviledges firstly appertaining thereunto should equally and indifferently be communicated to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as inferior species: as the like is easie to be seen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in all examples of this sort, as we have instanced in the foregoing part of the discourse.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>Integrum</hi> is wholly <hi>different,</hi> as it is a <hi>third</hi> arising from his members, so it ever hath <hi>somthing peculiar</hi> and not communicated unto them.</p>
                  <p>And hence it was, that the Papists, who maintained this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike visible Church, have created and fancied a visible Head to this visible Body, but that fond device labours now with the loathsomnesse of it selfe.</p>
                  <p>When Master <hi>H.</hi> is to make answer to this Argument he thus writes. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This is the main argument of the Pontificians, for the supremacy of the Pope, and that which made our Divines deny them a Church Catholike visible: But to the argument I answer that the Church had a Head of the same nature, consisting of body and soule who sometimes lived in this kingdom of grace in the dayes of his flesh, and did visibly partake in externall ordinances, though now indeed he be ascended into his kingdome of glory, yet ceaseth not to be a man, as we are, though glorified, and ceaseth not to rule and governe his Church, here below; for it is an everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome Isa. <hi>9.7.</hi> As when King <hi>James</hi> was translated from Scotland to England and lived here, he did not cease to be King in Scotland.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Reply is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>confession</hi> of Master. <hi>H.</hi> is very remarkable, which I desire the Reader to observe, and for ever to carry along with him in his consideration, that according to the concurring and joint judgement of <hi>all our divines,</hi> they saw it <hi>necessary to deny the Papist a Catholike visible Church,</hi> unlesse they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to grant them an officer, as a supreme visible Head: for so his words are expresse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This made our Divines deny the Pontificians a Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like visible, <hi>namely, That so</hi> they might deny a visible Head su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thereunto.</q> As though he had said, unlesse they had denied the one, they could not have denied the other.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:111062:127"/>
                  <p>This was the <hi>conclusive determination</hi> of <hi>all</hi> those worthy champions of the Lord, who opposed the supremacy of that man of sin in former ages: and I cannot but conceive their <hi>grounds</hi> impregnable: If the <hi>one</hi> be granted, the <hi>other</hi> cannot be avoided according to all the principles of well ordered policyes, and the rules of reason propounded in the foregoing arguments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The salve, which Master <hi>H.</hi> here applies, is so far from healing the sore, that it makes it worse, the physicke being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as bad if not more dangerous, then the desease: for,</p>
                  <p>When in his Answ. he would beare the Reader in hand that <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>man</hi> consisting of body and soule, and living in the Church must in that regard, be the <hi>visible head</hi> of his Church, though now ascended into heaven: I would affectionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him in Gods holy feare to consider what he writes. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not onely <hi>untrue,</hi> but very dangerous to hold, that <hi>Christ</hi> as meere <hi>man</hi> consisting of body and soule is a <hi>visible Head</hi> of his Church; and yet this he doth and must say, if he say any thing to the argument in hand: But upon this grant it will <hi>follow</hi> that Christ is such a head, that <hi>is not present</hi> with his Body, nor doth, nor can lend influence to his whole body, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof in all places: and therefore must not be sufficient to supply fully the necessities thereof; which how derogatory and prejudiciall to our blessed Saviour, and the fatherly love of God the father to his Church, I am perswaded his love to Christ, will make him more sensible of such indignity, then I am able to expresse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its certaine our Saviour is <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, God and man, who hath <hi>fulnesse</hi> of <hi>all grace</hi> and of all power committed to him, and so becomes fully fit to execute the place and office of such a head, to send all officers, to furnish them to the worke, and blesse them in the worke of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, for <hi>the gathering and perfecting of all his saints, untill they come unto the unity of the faith.</hi> So Beza in his confession: <hi>chap.</hi> 5. Artic. 5. <hi>Whitak.</hi> de Pontif. Rom. q 1. cap. 3. <hi>arg.</hi> 6. where disputing, that to he Head of the Church, was a burden too heavy for any man to beare, a worke too hard for any man to discharg, he issues the reason thus <hi>quare relinquendum est,</hi> &amp;c. therefore <hi>we must leave the worke to Christ, who, as he is everywhere, so he can doe all things; alias enim caput non esset, otherwise he should not be a Head.</hi>

Hence that which matter <hi>H.</hi> takes for granted, that <hi>Christ was</hi> a <hi>visible</hi> Head, and Monarch in the Church, is not safe, nor true, as hath appeared by the foregoing arguments, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by all ours that I meet withall. <hi>Whitaker de Pontif. Rom. q.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>ad.</hi> 5. <hi>Bellarm. arg. Christus igitur non dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat in terris ut visibilis monarcha, nec ideo venit in mundum ut monarchiae visibilis fundamenta jaceret, Christ did not reside in the world as a visible monarck, nor came he into the world to set it up.</hi> The like expressions Master <hi>H.</hi> may find often in <hi>Whitak. p.</hi> 533. 554. <hi>ut. supra. Christus missus non est ut Regnum visibile occuparet, aut se tanquam Dominum et Monarcham in Ecclesia gereret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When we dispute touching the distinction of an <hi>integrum</hi> from its members, we look that this <hi>distinction</hi> should be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>same kind;</hi> namely, the <hi>integrum</hi> must not onely have a distinct nature, but <hi>such</hi> a nature, as <hi>ariseth</hi> and <hi>results</hi> from the <hi>members;</hi> and <hi>so</hi> the <hi>Officer</hi> or officers, which are appropriate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, must have some sutable resemblance in regard of the <hi>kind</hi> of them with the other.</p>
                  <p>As the Nationall Church of the Jewes being a <hi>distinct kind</hi> of Church, had <hi>peculiar</hi> and distinct <hi>Officers</hi> and ordinances, which were <hi>nationall,</hi> beside those of the Synagogue: So the Catholike must have, if it be a Church made up of the particular Churches, "<hi>as the Nationall Church was made up of the Synagogues,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> words are, <hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence</hi> againe, from the former ground laid and proved, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, the Catholike Church receives being from the particulars, and therefore its <hi>after</hi> and <hi>out</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence they</hi> receive no being from it, because the <hi>integrum est totum cui partes sunt essentiales, non totum essentiale partibus,</hi> for that is as far wide from this, as heaven from earth; for let our sense and experience speak in this case. This <hi>totum Catholicum</hi> is aggregate of the particulars, as a <hi>heape</hi> is aggregated and made up of <hi>many stones.</hi> (Master <hi>H.</hi> pag. 24.) an Army of many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but our senses will say, if asked: the stones must be <hi>before</hi> the Heape; the Regiments in reason <hi>before</hi> the Army, that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of them.</p>
                  <p>That onely which puts faire colours upon this false conceit, is, the misapprehending of some particular examples, namely, when they say, that <hi>any</hi> portion of <hi>water</hi> divided, <hi>every</hi> part of it <hi>is</hi> water, and hath the name and nature of it. The Answer is,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:111062:128"/> That predication or <hi>affirmation</hi> is not by vertue of that division of a portion of water that is made, <hi>as integri in membra;</hi> for in very deed, it is professedly <hi>opposite</hi> thereunto: But it is because the <hi>nature</hi> is preserved in the least portion of it, and thence this predication this part of water, is water, is made good, because a <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>species</hi> are there preserved and attended, going along with the division of <hi>integri in membra.</hi> For when we say, <hi>haec a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua est aqua,</hi> the Arguments are <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>species:</hi> and the like may be said, and must be understood of the like examples. And that this is so, will easily appeare by instances, if we narrowly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the considerations and respects one from another.</p>
                  <p>Take a <hi>quart</hi> of water and divide it into <hi>two pints,</hi> here is a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> of <hi>integrum</hi> into its <hi>members:</hi> though each <hi>pint</hi> may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>water,</hi> yet <hi>a pint cannot</hi> be said to be a <hi>quart,</hi> because the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>that totum</hi> will not permit it.</p>
                  <q>From these particulars, as so many proved premises, inferred from the nature of an <hi>integrum, to the</hi> 2, 3, 5. <hi>conclusions</hi> of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>H.</hi> fall to the ground.</q>
                  <p>Nor can I see how the 5 and the 7, can stand together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the proper notion of the Church Catholike and particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be of</hi> integrum in membra, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. <hi>Then particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are essentials, and give matter and forme to the Catholike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore they cannot receive matter and forme</hi> from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, <hi>contrary to</hi> conclus. 7 pag. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> the Church Catholike <hi>existeth out of the particular</hi> Churches, as a heape out of so many stones, pag. 24. <hi>then</hi> they <hi>are before</hi> the Catholike, contrary to <hi>conclus.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>My second ground is that which Master <hi>H.</hi> grants, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church seemes to force. <q>The Catholike Church may by persecution, &amp;c. be brought into a little roome, and haply into one Congregation, <hi>pag. 24.</hi> yet all the essence and priviledges of the Church Catholike visible are contracted and preserved therein, and from them conveyed and derived to those whom they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, <hi>ibidem.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>grant,</hi> I offer these <hi>collections</hi> to consideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence</hi> this Catholike Church being an individuall, it must needs be <hi>species specialissima,</hi> and therefore can have <hi>no inferior</hi> to it, or subordinately under it, to which it can give <hi>nomen &amp; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi> for no man is so far forsaken of reason, as to affirme, <hi>This</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:111062:128"/> individuall Church is <hi>that</hi> individuall Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, wherein failes this kind of reasoning?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Catholica Ecclesia</hi> extends it selfe to all persons and places, <hi>conclus.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>But so cannot a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ecclesia particularis</hi> may faile: so cannot <hi>Ecclesia Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> gives part matter, and part forme to all particular Churches, <hi>conclus.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>But a particular Congregation cannot do so.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which is <hi>aggregatum of all particular</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and its <hi>nature</hi> consists in <hi>this,</hi> that it is <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Totum,</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of such an <hi>integrum</hi> cannot be preserved <hi>in one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>integrum</hi> cannot be made of <hi>one member:</hi> As though a man should say, there may be the nature of <hi>a heape</hi> reserved in <hi>one stone:</hi> The nature of a <hi>flock</hi> in <hi>one sheepe.</hi> A <hi>Corporation</hi> in <hi>one man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its true I confesse, I should easily yeild, that which all writers, all rules confirme, <hi>Tota natura generis conservatur in una specie:</hi> as the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man</hi> was preserved in <hi>one</hi> man <hi>Adam.</hi> But that an <hi>integrum</hi> made of many members should be intire and have his whole nature preserved in one, It is to me unconceiveable, unlesse Master <hi>H.</hi> will help us with another Logick, that never yet saw light. Should one affirme the body to be an intire body and not lame, which lacks all the members, but only the head or hand, it would be counted a strange affirmation.</p>
                  <p>Let us yet once againe look a little more seriously into that particular branch of the 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>conclusion,</hi> if haply something may be suggested to our secret thoughts, for our further consideration. Its said, "<hi>that</hi> Ecclesia Catholica <hi>was reserved in the family of</hi> Noah.</p>
                  <p>Beside the inconveniences mentioned before, we may thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquire: Its granted that the <hi>Church</hi> was appointed by God to be <hi>in families.</hi> Suppose <hi>Noah his sonnes,</hi> issuing out into their own families, as they did: <hi>Noah,</hi> he had his family intire: when <hi>Noah</hi> was dead, and his family dissolved, I aske where <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> was? It must needs be either in some of those families severally considered, or in <hi>a fourth family as an aggregatum</hi> of them all.</p>
                  <p>It could not be in the families <hi>severally</hi> considered, as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:111062:129"/> one of them should be, or could be truly called, <hi>Ecclesia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica.</hi> For <hi>which</hi> of them could claime that more then another?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> gives matter and forme to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as in the 7 <hi>conclus.</hi> but one family did not so to another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> consists of all the particulars as its members.</p>
                  <p>But no one did consist of the other two.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the <hi>second part</hi> be granted, <hi>to wit,</hi> that there should be <hi>a fourth family</hi> aggregated of all these: A mans sense gives sufficient confutation of this: for there was never any such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the word, nor conceived by any in that age: nor can there be such a one as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath deciphered to us, that should give part matter, part forme, to all the particulars, as in the seventh <hi>conclusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it privily implyes a <hi>contradiction:</hi> to be an <hi>aggregatum</hi> of particulars, and to give being unto them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Lastly, take we Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his definition of the Catholike Church as it respects <hi>all persons and places,</hi> as in the 1. <hi>conclus.</hi> And therefore, <hi>is the whole company of all beleevers in the whole world.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How will, or in truth can, <hi>this</hi> agree to the visible Church, when it was confined within the pale and limits of the land of <hi>Judea?</hi> Its confessed by all that I know, that God had no Church <hi>visible,</hi> to whom all Church priviledges and ordinances belonged, <hi>but onely that:</hi> And therefore all were bound to turne <hi>Jewes,</hi> and become <hi>Proselytes,</hi> before they could be said to be within the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the Church, or had any right to the seales, or to share in any priviledges thereof. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>And therfore all beleevers, that were not <hi>joyned</hi> to the people of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that were not incorporated into the Church, by subjecting themselves to the way and worship of God amongst them, and receiving <hi>circumcision</hi> in the foreskin of their flesh, they were debarred <hi>all Priviledges.</hi> Conceive we now <hi>Rahab</hi> converted to the faith, and as she was, its certaine many families in like sort might be.</p>
                  <p>By Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his principles, these were all of the Catholick Church, and had title to all Priviledges of the Church, which the words of the text professedly gainsayes. Nay compare we Mr. <hi>H. his way</hi> of the conveyance of the right of Church Priviledges, <hi>with Gods way,</hi> punctually expressed in his word, and then we
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:111062:129"/> shall see what accord there is. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thus writes, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Particular Churches are made up of the members of the Church Catholick, and pertake of the benefit and priviledges of the Church primarily, not because they are beleevers of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, but of the Church Catholick.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that we have Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his mind and method thus laid open before us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a man is converted to the profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and so becomes a visible believer, he is then a member of the visible Church Catholike.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath by this his profession and membership with the Church Catholike, right unto all Church priviledges.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He then becomes a member of a particular Church: but hath not right to Church priviledges, <hi>because of that,</hi> but because of his former membership with the Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p>This is his method.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods method</hi> in <hi>his</hi> word is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A person is <hi>converted</hi> and becomes a <hi>visible</hi> beleever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He comes to be <hi>adjoyned</hi> to the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> and turnes <hi>Proselyte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Because</hi> he is now converted and turned Jew, he may eat the Passeover, and enjoy all the other Priviledges, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.</p>
                  <p>It is hereby apparant that Gods method, and that which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> expresseth, is directly contradictory. The Lord sayes: Its not <hi>because a</hi> beleever, but because beleeving he <hi>joynes</hi> to the Church; therefore he partakes of Church Priviledges. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> affirmes: Its <hi>not because he joines</hi> to the Church, but because he is <hi>a beleever,</hi> that he hath right to the Priviledges of the Church: which are open contradictions <hi>in ipsis terminis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>ground</hi> formerly made good and granted, it follows in the second place, The Church <hi>visible</hi> was <hi>not of all people,</hi> nor in all places.</p>
                  <p>If the Church was confined within the pale of <hi>Judea,</hi> then was it not in all places.</p>
                  <p>If confined to such only as were Jews, or became such, then was it not of all people.</p>
                  <p>And by all that I can observe in the text or out of Interpreters, its plaine, that the <hi>sonnes of Keturah</hi> which were sent into the <hi>east,</hi> though they were circumcised, and in all appearance of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:111062:130"/> not only professed the faith (which were enough according to M. <hi>H.</hi> his principles, to make them members of the Catholike Church) but were some of them true and sincere-hearted belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: yet its most certain <hi>God</hi> did <hi>not account of them</hi> as a <hi>visible Church,</hi> nor did he betrust them with Church-Priviledges. The Psalmist therefore confines and impropriates <hi>them</hi> to the Jew. <hi>He hath not dealt so with any nation, neither have the Heathens knowledge of his wayes,</hi> Rom. 3.2. <hi>what is the Priviledge of the Jew? &amp;c. to them was committed the oracles of God, not to any other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore it is, that Divines, and those most judicious, conclude, and that with consent, that the Church was then <hi>in populo Israelitico,</hi> but now <hi>in populo Catholico:</hi> That it was then <hi>in a Nation,</hi> according to that, <hi>I will make of thee a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But now in <hi>all</hi> Nations, according to that, <hi>Go preach and teach all Nations; and in Christ</hi> there is <hi>no difference either of Jew or Grecian, Scythian, or Barbarian:</hi> and in <hi>this</hi> notion and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it is, that I conceive the <hi>visible Church may now be called Catholike,</hi> and not in the time of <hi>the Jew,</hi> because the Gospel is preached to all people universally and indifferently, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of all without any restraint, but was then confined <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Israelitico.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>These grounds being laid and proved, there is a ready way made to the right understanding of that which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in way of proof of his Assertion, the nature whereof we have now opened.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>demonstration</hi> as he termes it, is this.</p>
                     <q>If particular Churches be visible, then there is a visible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But particular Churches are visible. Therefore,</hi>
                        <q>Our Answer will be double.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. We shall enquire what our Writers and <hi>Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> do re urn to the <hi>Proposition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then we shall apply our selves to the second part, or <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> and by both, it will appear, that this Argument doth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:111062:130"/> not probably conclude the cause, much lesse necessarily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the Proposition.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Duraeus</hi> urged Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> with <hi>this Argument</hi> to maintaine a Catholike <hi>Church visible,</hi> which he and all ours do constantly deny, Master <hi>H.</hi> may be pleased to consider, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the Doctor makes <hi>Whitak. contra Duraeum Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccles. pag.</hi> 110. when <hi>Duraeus</hi> had thus laid down his Argument, <hi>Dic quaeso, si singulae Ecclesiae ex quibus veluti partibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, whereof the Church Catholike consists, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, be visible, and fall under our sight, will it not follow, that the Catholike Church will be visible also?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> had told him, that the Catholike Church is not to be confined to <hi>one age</hi> and time, but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>all</hi> the faithfull of <hi>all ages,</hi> which went <hi>before us,</hi> and are now in heaven, and then he demands of <hi>Duraeus,</hi> whether <hi>all these be visible or no?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he comes yet neerer home, and drives him to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter straight and narrow: <hi>Deinde ut Catholicam tuam ecclesiam in hoc seculum compingamus, tamen quousque particulares Ecclesiae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectabiles sunt, Catholica aspectabilis non erit.</hi> In a word he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and readily <hi>denyes the consequence,</hi> affirming <hi>That the members may be</hi> aspectabiles, <hi>but the whole not so.</hi> And gives the reason of his denyall, which is this. <hi>Si enim Catholica (ut tu dicis) consistit ex partibus, &amp;c. Loco supra citato. If the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like be aggregated of many parts, then when these parts are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, the whole may be seen, but the parts as severally cannot be seene.</hi> And addes, answerably <hi>when the parts are seene several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the</hi> Totum, <hi>as aggregated, cannot be seene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay if Master <hi>H.</hi> be pleased to review, how learned <hi>Sadeel</hi> deales with <hi>Turrian,</hi> propounding the very same Argument to him, in the very same termes, he will, and the <hi>Reader</hi> may perceive, what strength that judicious writer apprehended to be in this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> alledgeth and repeats this against <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and gives his approbation of it. The concurrence of those judgements of these two Worthies you may find, <hi>Whitak. de Eccles. controv.</hi> 2. <hi>q.c.</hi> 4. <hi>Arg.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ecclesiam Catholicam adversarii dicunt esse omnes Ecclesias par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulares, per totum terrarum orbem fusas, quae quia sunt visibiles, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam Catholicam exhis aggregatam visibilem esse affirmant.</hi>

                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:111062:131"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our Adversaries</hi> (saith Sadeel) <hi>affirme the Catholike Church to be all particular Churches spread through the whole world; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the particulars are visible, therefore they concludes the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick aggregated of all these to be visible also.</hi> (So that it is plain, the Papists plead the same Argument with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for their cause, as he now doth for his.)</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Sadeel</hi> and <hi>Whitaker</hi> both, make a <hi>round</hi> returne to him. <hi>Sed hoc nihil absurdius dici potest.</hi> They feare not to professe that the consequence is very absurd and destitute of any shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and therefore retort the argument, as marvellous strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. <hi>If the particular Churches severed be visible, then the whole aggregated cannot be visible: And if the aggregatum be visible, they cannot be visible.</hi> As they instance. If there be ten flocks of sheep severall, they are and may be seen severed one from another: But then one Catholick flock gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all these cannot be seen.</p>
                     <p>By this which hath been alledged, two things the Reader may attend:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How feeble these judicious writers judged the force of the consequence of the Argument.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its evident by their whole debate, that they take it as a thing supposed, that to make up a <hi>Totum aggregatum,</hi> there must be in reason <hi>the aggregation of the members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it is not enough to make up a <hi>Totum aggregatum,</hi> that the severall members are under the <hi>same lawes,</hi> and governed <hi>after the same manner. For that</hi> which may and doth belong to those that are not aggregated in any such a whole, that cannot be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give a proper nature or <hi>formality</hi> to such an <hi>aggregatum:</hi> for things common do not give any proper and differencing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>But these</hi> forenamed, to wit, to be govern'd by the same laws, and ruled after the same manner, may, and doth befall those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are not under such an aggregation.</p>
                     <p>Thus severall Free cities and House-Towns, which are entire in themselves: Severall Countreys and Kingdomes, who have nothing to do with each other in their precincts and Jurisdictions, yet may have the same lawes, and the same manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Only that, wh ch makes them an entire and compleat common-wealth in themselves, is the aggregation of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>same governours</hi> as <hi>the chiefe,</hi> whether <hi>one</hi> single person as in a <hi>monarchicall,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> as in an <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> state.</p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:111062:131"/>
                     <p>And this might suffice for a satisfactory answer for the present, but I shall go a nearer way to worke, and as they have denied the consequence, I shall deny the second part or <hi>assumption,</hi> Namely, <hi>that particular congregations are not members,</hi> (but <hi>species</hi>) of a Church, which as a <hi>genus</hi> exists, and works, and is preserved in each particular, and as far as <hi>visibility</hi> may be given to a <hi>generall, existing,</hi> and acting in the individuals, I shall <hi>not gainsay</hi> it: for it is that I have opened and defended in the foregoing part of the discourse. Such a <hi>Totum universale</hi> I grant, and do not know any either do or indeed can deny; but this serves not the Papists turne at all.</p>
                     <p>For the generall nature of a Church being determined to its particulars, and existing therein, all particular Churches do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually and indifferently from thence receive all the Church-power and priviledges that are common, and there <hi>needs no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible monarch</hi> over all Churches, but fairhfull <hi>Pastors</hi> and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, set <hi>over every</hi> particular congregation, for improvement of all ordinances, Sacraments, and censures for the good thereof.</p>
                     <p>Nor will it suit Master <hi>H.</hi> Because we need not (if we will follow the levell of this truth, as it leads us) goe about by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike visible Church aggregated of all, before we come to a congregation, but we must be necessitated to attend upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation; for there both <hi>the essence and priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>first</hi> to be found, because the genus first exists there.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>H.</hi> conceiving <hi>such an answere</hi> might be made, he frames it as an <hi>objection</hi> against himselfe, and makes onely <hi>this</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that he takes the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> in regard of its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be <hi>Integri in membra</hi> but the <hi>proofs</hi> which should settle it, are no whit sufficient.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He alledgeth an expression out of Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 32. part 4 <hi>particulares istae congregationes sunt partes similares ecclesiae Catholicae,</hi> which words, its certaine, doe properly and directly consider particular congregations <hi>as spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of a Church, and were so intended by the Author, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the next word.</p>
                     <p>True in the following words, he speaks of <hi>ecclesia Catholica, as integrum,</hi> but rather as putting such a notion upon it, or analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the reason of such an apprehension, then concluding that there is any such <hi>reality existing.</hi> For in the first words of that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:111062:132"/> chap. the thus writes, <hi>ecclesia, quae in terris agit, non est tota simul visibilis.</hi> Therefore this <hi>aggregation</hi> is not visible (for in that the nature of this <hi>Totum integrale lyes</hi>) so that this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> neither hurts ours, nor helps Master <hi>H.</hi> his cause,</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>H.</hi> addes also one argument.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>"∆≤bi omnes partes existunt simul compactae, ibi totum existit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Sed omnes partes ecclesiae Catholicae visibilis existunt simul compactae.</q>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>ecclesia Catholica visibilis existit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The minor he proves out of Eph. 4.16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. The conclusion</hi> may be granted in a right sense, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to our defence at all. 1. Where the particular members of a congregation are compacted in covenant of the Church, and with Church officers, there is a particular Church. 2. Where there are many particular Churches, amongst them, there is <hi>Totum genericum existens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>this</hi> sense, (which is the sense of the place) all may be granted: but in <hi>his</hi> sense, the <hi>minor is denyed,</hi> namely, that all particular congregations do <hi>exist aggregated together as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick;</hi> that should have been proved, but is not touched, much lesse evidenced.</p>
                     <p>And if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had attempted to shew how all particular Churches <hi>are aggregated</hi> or compacted <hi>in toto integrali,</hi> which <hi>ariseth out</hi> of them, and hath somewhat <hi>peculiar to it</hi> selfe, and not common to them, he had helped the cause with some proof, and us with some light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The particular</hi> taken from the Apostles and Evangelists, namely, it must therefore be a Catholike Church, because they were <hi>given</hi> to it, we shall meet with it, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. where it shall receive a full answer.</p>

                     <p>We have thus done with Mr. <hi>H. demonstration,</hi> and we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it doth appear, that it doth not necessarily inforce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>

                     <p>We shall now weigh, with like liberty, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which he propounds to this end and purpose.</p>
                     <p>The first alledged by him, is, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.3. and to this also may that be referred; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. because the aime of the Spirit is the same in both, and the second is but a relation of the first.</p>
                     <p>Now that by <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.3. cannot be meant <hi>catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica ecclesia visibilis,</hi> is thus plain.</p>
                     <p>That Church is there meant, which <hi>Paul</hi> persecuted.</p>
                     <p>But he could not, nor did he persecute the whole company of professing beleevers in the whole world, for he could not see them, nor know them.</p>
                     <p>Beside, he did not persecute the Church of the Jewes in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>i. e. the Jewish Church,</hi> and yet its certain, there were there many that believed: but as the text saith, and he affirms of himselfe, he persecuted <hi>that way,</hi> and all that he knew of that way: which was indeed the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in Jerusalem, now erected by the Apostles, and there exceedingly increased by the blessing of the Lord, and therefore <hi>Church</hi> is put by a sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche, for that <hi>particular Church:</hi> and that also for the men and members of it, that <hi>Paul</hi> could take notice of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.2 so the words are, <hi>if he found any of that way,</hi> them he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to pursue, and so did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The probabilities</hi> intimated to the contrary by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> do not evince; as first when he saith, <q>It was not a particular Church, because the persecution was in Jerusalem, <hi>Damascus,</hi> and even to strange cities.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> True, no wonder because he persecuted all that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that way of the Christian Church, and those by reason of a great persecution were scattered abroad throughout all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> they fled far and wide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might persecute them where he found them, as he did, hunting after them with eagernesse and madnesse of malice. Thus Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> expounds the place, <hi>controv.</hi> 2. <hi>de eccles. p.</hi> 456</p>
                     <p>When Mr. <hi>H.</hi> addes, an <hi>indefinite is equivalent to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> he will find that it is not alwayes so upon second thoughts, as innumerable instances might be brought to evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet lastly is there the same reason, that the word <hi>Church</hi> here should reach all other Churches. For the Apostle gives in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:111062:133"/> a peculiar ground why he was thus carried, namely he persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their way, not simply because they were beleevers. (For such many in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were that were of the Jewish Church <hi>Acts</hi> 5.13.14. But because they made this manner of profession touching Christ and salvation by him alone, rejecting the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law.</p>
                     <q>To this also you may referre these <hi>two</hi> other Scriptures: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>God added to the Church such as should be saved.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p n="1">1. That is <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> company of beleevers <hi>in the whole world:</hi> for such a company they never saw nor knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be added to them: But to the Christian Church now erected: and therefore it is said, <hi>they continued in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, in their fellowship,</hi> Act. 2.42.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There were many beleevers of the Jewish Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.14. and therefore they who met of that Church, could not be added to them, but to the Apostolicall and Christian Church. And therefore,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> But must it therefore be meant of the <hi>Cathol ke Church visible,</hi> and that as <hi>integrum?</hi> the consequent deserves a denyall; and that it cannot be meant of the Catholike Church, the words of the text give apparant testimony.</p>
                     <p>That Church which is contra-distinct to the Jewes, that cannot comprehend the <hi>whole</hi> company of beleevers, <hi>through the whole world,</hi> because some beleevers were of the Jewes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                     <p>But this Church is so contra-distinct.</p>

                     <q>But he cannot so offend the <hi>whole</hi> company of beleevers, <hi>through the whole world:</hi> because a scandall must be seene or known certainly: but so a persons practise cannot be to all beleevers in the whole world.</q>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>meaning</hi> is plaine, we must not offend those that are without, nor yet the <hi>beleeving Jewes,</hi> nor any of the <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles,</hi> who are brought home unto Christ, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church.</p>

                     <p>Unlesse, as I said, it be meant of <hi>the invisible Church,</hi> unto which Master <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi> seeme to incline, because first the Apostle speaks of such things that appertain only to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as <hi>v.</hi> 9. he speaks of <hi>all things created by Christ Jesus,</hi> i. e. all the elect &amp; called (say they, <hi>i. e.</hi> those former interpreters mentioned) 2. This discovery of wisdome is in <hi>v.</hi> 12. according to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall councell in Christ Jesus intended towards his elect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in those dispensations this wisedome appeares, which drives the very thoughts to a mazement: But however it be taken, it helps nothing to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his <hi>Ecclesia Catholica.</hi>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:111062:134"/> universale</hi> existing and determined in its actings by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, or if you will, The Apostle points at <hi>one particular,</hi> but includes <hi>all particulars</hi> by <hi>a parity and proportion of reason.</hi> As God set <hi>in the Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth, and so in all Ghurches,</hi> Apostles and Teachers.

                     <p>The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is Christs body, and so are all the Churches instituted by Christ. They are all one in the generall nature of them, and those priviledges which belong in common to them all equally and indifferently.</p>
                     <q>Let us now see what is said for the confirmation of the <hi>sense,</hi> for which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> alledgeth them.</q>
                     <p>The greatest cost that he bestowes upon that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. as conceiving that to be most pregnant, and therefore prudently gathers in upon the dispute thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It cannot be meant of the triumphant or invisible Church, but the visible, and that not essentialis, but organica,</hi> both which we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, and confesse his reason good, as formerly we have done to <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.</hi> Rutherford</p>

                     <p>
                        <q>But the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are so set in a Church, as yet they have no limits in their office, therefore that Church must be a Catholike Church.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> proposition or <hi>consequence</hi> is denied, as not sutable to the truth, which may thus appeare.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>reason</hi> of their <hi>unlimitednesse</hi> arose from their <hi>commission,</hi> because it was <hi>generall,</hi> being immediately called and appointed by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:111062:134"/> God to <hi>preach to all nations,</hi> and so had power to plant all Churches, &amp; had vertually all Church power in them: but this did not issue <hi>nextly</hi> from the Church, in which they were <hi>firstly</hi> set.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>eleven Apostles</hi> were first set and <hi>over the Christian Church</hi> erected in Act. 1. where there was a company of an 120, can any man reason from hence thus?</p>
                     <p>In what Church the Apostle were set, that is the Catholike Church, and the whole company of all believers in the whole world. But they were set in that Church mentioned Act. 1. and chap. 2.47. therefore that 120 were the whole company of all belivers in the whole world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> Church where <hi>Deacons</hi> are <hi>set,</hi> that Church is not an unlimited Church.</p>

                        <hi>But</hi> ordinary <hi>Deacons</hi> were set in the same Church, wherein the Apostles were set, as in the place. 1 Cor. 12. its affirmed <hi>joyntly</hi> and <hi>indifferently</hi> of them <hi>both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore</hi> that Church doth not argue an unlimited power.</p>
                     <p>The minor proposition is expresse in the text.</p>
                     <p>The major is sure, as being bottomed upon confessed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ordinary officers have not an illimited power, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their proper charges, because that is one maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt them and extraordinary ones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> which is impossible for a <hi>Deacon</hi> to performe, that our Lord Christ never imposed, never exacted at his hands, nor doth it belong to his office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> for a Deacon, called <hi>Helps,</hi> in the 1 Cor. 12. to distribute to the whole company of all believers in the whole world, is, and was ever impossible.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Teachers be unlimited in their work, then an ordinary officer hath power over all the Churches, and is bound to feed and watch over all. and so there is a rode waye for <hi>Tot quots</hi> and <hi>pluralityes.</hi>

                     <p>Its true, there be <hi>common operations,</hi> ordinances, priviledges, that belong to a congregationall Church, as <hi>Totum genericum,</hi> firstly, and therefore are attributed and given to all particular congregations <hi>secondarily,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> they are acted and existing, so they may be, and there, are easily and evidently apprehended.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But Catholica ecclesia visibilis</hi> cannot do this, for we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there is no such <hi>ecclesia aggregata:</hi> and <hi>non entis non est notio.</hi>

                     <p>In the place of the <hi>Ephes. c.</hi> 4.12. that <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>one</hi> in regard of the common nature of it, which as <hi>Totum generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> is communicated to all the particulars, with all the common priviledges, that by a likenesse and proportion of reason is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
                     <p>That resemblance of the <hi>worldly empire,</hi> hath been formerly confuted, and the disproportion demonstrated; for there must be some peculiar act and officer, belonging to the Church as such an <hi>integrum,</hi> as it is in all worldly empires, wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity consists, and comes to be apprehended which is not to be found in the Church.</p>
                     <p>The consideration of <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Totum genericum</hi> gives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to all those places where the word <hi>Kingdome</hi> is used to signifie the visible Church, and therefore I might spare here any repetition, and leave the Reader to make the application him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but the truth is, the word <hi>Kingdome</hi> in many of the places here quoted, carries another sense, and doth not reach the cause in hand, much lesse conclude it; as will thus appear by the tryall of the particulars.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kingdome of heaven</hi> beside other significations, as the <hi>Kingdome of glory, &amp;c.</hi> it doth by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> (so its frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used in the Evangelists,) imply the <hi>word</hi> of the Kingdome and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:111062:136"/> the <hi>dispensation</hi> and <hi>administration</hi> of the Gospell in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the speciall things appertaining thereunto, The <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is like to a man sowing of seed,</hi> Matth. 13.24. <hi>like to Mustard seed.</hi> 31. <hi>to Leaven.</hi> 33. <hi>to treasure hid in the field.</hi> 44. The <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>not</hi> like to Leaven or seed, but the dispensation of the Gospell is.</p>
                     <p>And so it must be understood in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Then shall Christ deliver up the kingdome unto God the father. That</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot be the Catholike Visible Church, because that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of sound hearted Christians and false hearted <hi>hypocrites, these</hi> are not delivered up into the hand of the father, that he may be all in all, to them.</p>
                     <p>Beside Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his <hi>owne</hi> words are witnesse enough against this sense, for so he writes in the place, p. 15. <q>Its the Kingdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the visible Church, in Ordinances of worship.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is to be exercised in that visible Church; it's therefore distinct from it in sense and signification.</p>
                     <p>To this head also belongs that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore receiving a kingdome that cannot be shaken,</hi> &amp;c. This kingdome is not the Catholike visible Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For, <hi>that</hi> kingdome is here meant, which cannot <hi>be shaken.</hi> But this may be shaken by strong persecution, and the most of the members of it, the particular Churches destroyed and dissolved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its a kingdome which is <hi>unlike</hi> that which was in <hi>the Old-Testament,</hi> and the unlikelynes lies in this, that <hi>this now</hi> in the time of the Gospell <hi>cannot be moved,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> was: whereas the Church, for its existence, is subject to be as much shaken now, as that under the Law.</p>
                     <p>But the fairest <hi>construction</hi> of the words, and most <hi>full</hi> to the scope of the place, is to shew how farre differing the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wayes of Gods <hi>worship,</hi> which is <hi>now</hi> appointed by him, is from <hi>that</hi> which was ordained <hi>under the Law:</hi> Those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and administrations are now come to an end, and others instituted in their place and roome: but these we haue now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell are <hi>last,</hi> and so the <hi>unalterable</hi> institutions of our Saviour: and thus Mr. <hi>H.</hi> expresseth himselfe; carryed, as it should seeme, with the constraining evidence of the words. <q>This kingdome cannot be meant <hi>(saith he)</hi> of the internall kingdome of grace, but it is meant of the externall ordinances of worship and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: <hi>but I suppose</hi> those <hi>are</hi> not <hi>the</hi> Church, <hi>and therefore ther

                     </p>
                     <p>Much lesse is there any colour of such a conceit in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of heaven is at hand: i. e.</hi> the Catholike Church is at hand; how harsh is such a sound to a mans eare, such a sense to a mans mind?</p>
                     <p>The rest of the places, where <hi>kingdome</hi> signifyes the Church, as <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. So likewise those similitudes of <hi>floore</hi> and <hi>field,</hi> they point out <hi>all</hi> particular <hi>Congregations</hi> under that condition, which is <hi>common</hi> to them all, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they are made up of a mixed multitude of good and bad, or which is all one, they looke at the generall nature of a Congregation existing in its particulars: but put not on the relation <hi>of members to an integrum</hi> at all. Nor doth the seeming reason of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> alledged to the contrary, carry any constraining force to perswade a man seriously judicious. For when he thus writes pag. 15,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Now if these things (those to wit, which were spoken concerning field, floore, Kingdome) were spoken of a particular Congregation onely: <hi>which</hi> particular Congregation in the world shall impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate these to it selfe? but if true of every one in particular, and all in generall, and these all be continually called one kingdome, then there is a Church Catholike visible, <hi>to wit,</hi> totum integrale.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The answer will be easie and ready at hand: That our expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and apprehensions looke not at any thing impropriate to one, but <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>common</hi> to all, and true of all, because all these particulars are <hi>unum genere.</hi> And the generall nature is one in them all: and it is but reason, that in that regard they should be called one. But thence to gather, that therefore there is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike visible Church, as <hi>totum integrale,</hi> is to wrong the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the text, and to wring out blood instead of milke: Nay in truth to make the conclusion to oppose the premises, and his own expressions.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>That which is common to all the particulars, that cannot be an <hi>integrum,</hi> but a <hi>genus:</hi> as the rules and definitions of <hi>genus</hi> of necessity require.</p>
                        <p>Those are his premises.</p>
                        <p>Take his expressions, <hi>If true of every particular, and all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:</hi> whence the issue will come to this:</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>That which is true of all the particulars, as a generall, that must
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:111062:137"/> needs be a <hi>genus,</hi> and not an <hi>integrum</hi> to them.</p>
                     <p>The first Mr. <hi>H</hi> affirmes; therefore the second cannot be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The place of Matth.</hi> 16.18. attonitos tenet interpretes, like the body of <hi>Asahell,</hi> puts every man to a stand, that passeth by.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that doting delusion of the Papists, making <hi>Peters</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the <hi>rock,</hi> is hissed out of all, that have attained any eye-salve of the Scripture, to cleere their understanding in the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet there remaine more difficulties and mysteries in some parts of the Text, which were never seene with any full convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidence to this day, though many have set themselves, and that sadly to the search thereof.</p>
                     <p>We will only attend the particular here specified by Master <hi>H. what Church is here understood?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though I must confesse (for I love to be plaine) that I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement, that the <hi>visible church</hi> is here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: yet I must professe also, that his proofe is no way sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory either to evidence that it must be visible, much lesse a <hi>Catholike visible Church:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For when it was objected, that this was an <hi>invisible</hi> Church, here spoken of, because the <hi>visible may faile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He onely speaks to the second part, that the Catholike Church cannot faile: but that this was not an invisible Church here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he doth not at all prove, nor in truth set about it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His reason whereby he would perswade that the visible Church <hi>nunquam deficit;</hi> hath not strength in it, nor truth in it, though the conclusion be true, which he would maintaine; For he thus disputes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If all visible members should faile, then all the invisible must faile also: for none are invisible in this world, but must be visible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: except any be converted and fed onely by inspiration, which we have no ground for in the Scripture.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The frame stands thus,</p>
                     <p>If none be invisible members in this world, but they must be visible members also: when visible failes, then the invisible failes also.</p>
                     <p>But the first is true; there be no visible, but they be invisible also. The assumption deserves a deniall and that I suppose upon second thoughts, he will grant upon his <hi>owne principles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:111062:137"/>1. For its most certain, that an invisible gracious Saint, may justly be cast out of the Church</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its as certaine to Master <hi>Hudson</hi> that he that is cast out and excommunicate from one congregation, is cast out of all congregations, and out of the <hi>Catholike visible</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>Hence I would reason.</p>
                     <p>He that is cast out of all visible Churches, and the Church Catholike, he is no visible member for excommunication cuts off visible membership.</p>
                     <p>But he that is and remaines an invisible member, may be justly cast out of all visible Churches, and so the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a man may remaine an invisible, and yet not be a visible member.</p>
                     <p>That which is added for proofe toucheth not the cause: for a man cast out, and so no member, may be fed by word, and prayer and fasting, promises, conferences, readings, without any inspiration, and this the scriptures abundantly declare, and each mans experience will make good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Besides,</hi> it hath been made good, that a man may out of the weaknesse of his judgement conceiving the Churches not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, refuse to be baptised, and so be no member of the Church, and yet be a Saint truely gracious, according to their principles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Againe,</hi> suppose a person fall into some notorious evill, and for that cause, all the Churches may reject him, and deny him communion, he is then no member visible: and yet he is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible one.</p>
                     <p>Its not a little <hi>dangerous</hi> to lay the foundation of the <hi>not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our <hi>grace,</hi> upon the <hi>not failing</hi> of <hi>Church membership,</hi> which this doth. This were enough to make it appeare, that this place lends no reliefe to the conclusion: because it doth not prove a visible Church here intended.</p>
                     <p>But let this be granted. I would yet adde, that this cannot be a Catholike Church of Master <hi>H.</hi> his cut. For I would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from his owne words and explication, which I think have waight in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Church</hi> which onely includes the Church of the Gentiles, and <hi>that to be built,</hi> that cannot comprehend the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the faithfull in the whole world, and so cannot be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</p>

                        <hi>But this</hi> Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. (by Master <hi>H.</hi> his owne words) <hi>includes only the Church evangelicall of the Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> hath sense to settle it, for there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church of the Jewes true believers and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is Master <hi>H.</hi> his own expression <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <q>We are now neere home. The last place, where any strength of dispute lies, is in 2. Epist. of <hi>John</hi> v. 10. where excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is called <hi>casting out of the Church.</hi>
                     </q>

                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Church, per synechdochen generis pro specie,</hi> which is most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and familiar in the Scripture, <hi>That particular Church</hi> where Diotrephes usurped preeminence, is understood.</p>
                     <p>So its used <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Feed the flock, over whom ye are set,</hi> and that was the Church, which Christ <hi>hath redeemed,</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words. And our ordinary speech is generally in this straine, such a man is cast <hi>out of the Church,</hi> meaning that <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregation</hi> in which he was <hi>incorporate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>Let us heare how Master <hi>H.</hi> can force any Catholike visible Church, with any concluding evidence, from hence. His words are as followes.</q>
                     <p>
                        <q>If the Church here be a visible Church, I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man truely excommunicated in one congregation, is not thereby excommunicated from brotherly fellowship in all congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, yes, and what is gained from thence? therefore there is a Church Catholick visible. The inference is weak of reason. For when a person is justly excommunicate from the congregation in which he was, it followes of necessity, <hi>all that fellowship he might enjoy, by vertue of communion of Churches must of necessity be denied unto him, and he justly deprived thereof:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the vertue of his fellowship with one, he gained fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with others: and therefore when he is justly deprived of the one, by the censure of the Church, he must in all reason be deprived of the other; but by what strength of inference a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick visible Church should be concluded from hence, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I see not.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> conceive that the party was an actuall member of every congregation, and that when one congregation cuts the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:111062:138"/> party off from his particular membership he had with it, by the same act, it cuts him off from all the other. If this be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there be as many mistakes almost as words in such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and therefore the inference must be wholly destitute of strength and truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>That which is added afterwards, is yet much further from the mark, as when he addes.</hi> I would know whether the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up to Satan, is only within the bounds of one congregation, so that if he remove out of such a circuit or circle of ground to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is out of Satans bounds again, and may communicate there safely.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The frame stands thus.</p>
                     <p>If a person excommunicate is not cut off from his member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with every particular congregation, and so from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall visible Church, then when he removes from such a circuit of ground, he may communicate.</p>
                     <p>But this last is untrue, namely when he is out of the circuit of ground, he may againe communicate, therefore.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>consequence</hi> is conjured into such a circle of a conceit that its beyond the compasse of common reason, unlesse Mr. <hi>H.</hi> should imagine, that excommunication only casts a man out of a circuit of ground or that the power of Satan were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to some circle, I wonder how such a consequence came into his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, The power of excommunication lies in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation, where a person injoyes his membership with the Saints of God, under the kingdome of Jesus Christ. And when a party is cast out of that, and delivered up unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and into the Kingdome of darknesse, let him be where he will, and go where he will, he is under the Kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and all the Churches should look at him as a Traytor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, and so deal with him, as one uncapable of Church-communion.</p>
                     <p>Those two places, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. and last, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. are either understood of the Church invisible, as the circumstances seem to intimate; or else they shew that unity, and so community of the dispensation of Christ in all the Churches of the Gentiles, with which the generall nature of a Church formerly opened and disputed fully suits, and therefore gives no appearance of a proof for <hi>Catholica ecclesia visibilis</hi> as <hi>Totum inegrale</hi> and <hi>i aggregatum.</hi>

                     <p>We have now done with the first Question.</p>
                     <q>The reasons and Scriptures brought for the proof thereof, have been answered and satisfied: so that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and confession of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> we shall not need to adde any thing of the second.</q>
                     <p>For this was like the maine pillar, upon which the whole frame was built, which failing utterly, the whole must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall to the ground. This Question being plucked up by the roots, upon which the other and all the consectaries and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions grew, they will wither presently of their own accord. This bottome breaking, there needs no battery further to be erected against the rest of the discourse: it moulders away without any more ado, and therefore I shall ease my selfe and the Reader of any further pains to be improved that way.</p>
                     <p>Onely for a close, I shall be bold to offer some few considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his more serious tryall touching <hi>some propositions, two</hi> whereof are expressed in the tenth and eleventh conclusion; the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> may be found in the eleventh page. All these I shall shortly set down and suddainly expresse my reasons, why as yet I cannot yeeld assent thereunto, and so leave the whole debate.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="proposition">
                        <head>I. Proposition is laid down in these words</head>
                        <p>
                           <q>Those parts <hi>(that is a particular congregation)</hi> are limited and distinguished from others, by the civil and prudentiall limits, for conveniency of meeting and maintainance, and transacting of businesse.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which seems here <hi>difficult,</hi> I shall thus suggest.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That severall congregations are separated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in place; as it is a thing that a mans sense can determine, which admits no gainsaying, so I suppose its not the aime of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> nor the scope he intends, nor which he would have the Reader to attend in those words: but <hi>his purpose</hi> is to point out <hi>that wherein the distinguishing and differencing formality of one congregation from another consists,</hi> as the followings words and speciall instance used to that end, gives in abundant evidence.</p>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:111062:139"/>
                        <p>But this apprehension, I cannot yet see how it suits with the nature of a particular Church, or the nature of a <hi>forme</hi> whence this act of distinguishing properly issues.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That which <hi>formally</hi> and truly distinguisheth, is <hi>internall</hi> to the thing: but <hi>this</hi> is <hi>externall</hi> and meerly adventitious.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That which is <hi>common,</hi> nor doth, nor can distinguish; but this is so.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>That</hi> which distinguisheth truly, it is the <hi>forme</hi> of the thing properly and firstly, <hi>or else</hi> it proceeds as a <hi>peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> from it: its either <hi>essentiale constituens</hi> or <hi>consequens:</hi> but this is neither, for neither the forme nor property are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: <hi>but thus the place or limits are.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. If <hi>this</hi> distinguisheth one congregation from another, how comes it that to his and each mans experience, not only in the <hi>same Town,</hi> but in the <hi>same meeting</hi>-house there be severall and distinct Churches? As the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Churches in <hi>Colchester. If the distinction</hi> of congregations issued from the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the place,</hi> then they who were in the same place, they should not be distinguished. Then the Dutch Church in <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> should be English: for they are both within the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, and either do or may at severall times meet and assemble within the same stone wals of the Church so called.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If <hi>the diverse limits of the place,</hi> did put a difference distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive upon a congregation, then the place of the Merchants, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from <hi>Delph</hi> to <hi>Rotherdam,</hi> because they are in <hi>distinct places,</hi> therefore they are <hi>distinct Churches;</hi> and so by moving and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in severall places, one congregation should differ from it selfe; and as before many congregations were one, now one and the same should become many.</p>
                        <p>Its true if the demand be, of what particular Church we speak, or to what Church we would write, its usuall and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to describe the Church <hi>by the place,</hi> as the common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject where it hath its abode: but this is no proof that therefore a common subject should give a distinguishing difference of that from another.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Christian Church of the</hi> 120. was erected in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> beside the Church of the Jewes formerly instituted, and yet not abrogated, was it ground sufficient thus to conclude, because they are in the same city, therefore they are the same Church? I suppose the inference will be judged unsound by all;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:111062:140"/> and yet if the differencing distinction issued from the place, it would undeniably follow they were not at all dstinguished each from other.</p>

                           <q>The membership of a particular Church is devolved on him, by Gods disposing providence, by reason of his birth, or cohabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there, or voluntarily assumed, by his voluntary removall into the place allotted out by civill prudence, for such a particular so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to enjoy such ordinances of God conveniently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this <hi>assertion I cannot give my assent,</hi> and shall presently give in my reasons when I have breifly laid open the meaning of the expressions.</p>
                        <p>When Master <hi>H.</hi> seemes to lay severall grounds, by which membership comes to be attained, I suppose in the last resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they issue all in one, namely, <hi>the constancy of abode and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, within the limits of such a place.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For imagine that a man hath an inheritance fallen to him by <hi>birth</hi> in such a towne, if yet he will let it, or set it out to another and reside in another place, <hi>his birth</hi> doth not devolve his membership upon him in that place. For if he were <hi>borne heire</hi> to lands in 20 <hi>places</hi> or parishes, should he have membership in all, when he doth abide but in one? I believe Master <hi>H.</hi> would deny such an inference.</p>
                        <p>The like I may say of <hi>removeall:</hi> If he did but as Travelour and messenger, take up his habitation, I suppose Master <hi>H.</hi> would not affirme he was a member in the place because he lodged two or three nights or so many weeks or months in a place.</p>
                        <p>That I may then put the fairest construction upon his words that in love and prudence, and ingenuity I can, I conceive the meaning to be this, <hi>where a person takes up his hahitation,</hi> whether he haue right to it by birth, or it come by gift, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, or hiring, &amp;c. <hi>his membership issues</hi> from hence imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he <hi>takes up his constant abode</hi> within the limits of such a place or parish.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But that this cannot give the formality of membership,</hi> I have
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:111062:140"/> formerly proved, and I confesse I doe a little strange that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hudson</hi> a man learned should fall in with such an opinion, which I cannot perceive gains so much from any Judicious at this time, that they are willing to speake a good word for it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>For no civill rule can give an ecclesiasticall right.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Because those are two kinds of goverment opposite one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other, and each of them intire and compleat within it selfe.</p>
                        <q>2. This <hi>destroyes the censure of excommunication</hi> and wholly furstrats the power thereof, that it can never attaine its end. For the scope of the censure is to cut a person off from his membership and communion with the Church, as the name of excommunication and the nature of the ordinance requires.</q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But if the Priviledges</hi> of membership be devolved upon me by a <hi>civill right</hi> and cohabitation, <hi>This,</hi> excommunication nor doth, nor indeed can take awaye. And therefore upon this ground it cannot take away my membership and communion with the Church.</p>
                        <p>And therefore is by this meanes wholly made voide and of none effect.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>If right of</hi> cohabitation gives membership, <hi>Then Turks and Jewes</hi> may be members, and they and their children have right to all Church ordinances as well as any: <hi>Then</hi> men may <hi>make</hi> themselves members of a congregation though they be never so scandalous and unworthy to be received; nay though the congregation be never so desirous, in a just way according to the rules of Christ, to hinder their proceeding, and reject them from their communion: which Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> and all rules and reasonable men gaine say: In a word, by this grant, all the power of Churches and censures and ordinances would be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated or prophaned.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>pretended inconvenience</hi> which perswades him to imbrace this opinion, is, because, to be in a city, and not to be a member of the Church in the city, it seemes to imply an unchurching of those places, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But I answer it doth <hi>but seem</hi> so, it doth in no wise doe any such thing: <hi>only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <q>Particular Churches are made up of the members of the Church Catholike, and partake of the benefits and priviledges of the Church primarily, not because they are members of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, but of the Catholike.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In these words, there is <hi>something implied, something expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: To neither</hi> of which I can <hi>give assent</hi> unlesse some proof bee alledged, which may prevaile with my judgement, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thereunto which as yet I see none.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That which is implied is this,</hi> That the Catholike Church may have its being, when as yet there be no particular congregations existing; for this the words of the proposition doe necessarily presuppose.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>If particular Churches be made up of the members of the Catholike: then the Catholike Church and the members thereof must have a being, before <hi>either</hi> can give a being to the particular.</p>
                           <p>But I see no rule of reason, nor testimony of holy writ as yet to settle such an assertion.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>For lay aside in our consideration the confederation, and combination of Christians, which make up particular Churches: let it be supposed there be hundreds of Christians, who are visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble believers, scattered up and downe in severall coasts of the world, these now according to the methode of Master <hi>H.</hi> his frame of <hi>Church policy</hi> will first make up a Catholike visible Church, and out of that, particular Assemblies will afterwards arise.</p>
                        <p>This is the frame of Master <hi>Hudsons</hi> Church-policy: but this seemes contrary to the principles of <hi>all bodies politick:</hi> that ever were, are, or shall be. <hi>For there neither is, nor can be an externall body politick</hi> (of that kind we now speake) <hi>made up and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of people that never were in externall communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (haply) <hi>never had the sight and knowledge one of another,</hi> as it is here supposed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>True</hi> it is, if there were many thousands professing and beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the name of Christ: so many as were sincere have union and communion with Christ invisibly, and so make up an invisible
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:111062:141"/> Church Catholike. But that there should be an externall visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble particular <hi>body politick,</hi> either <hi>civill,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> (which this <hi>Catholica Ecclesia,</hi> as <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> must be) and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted of men, which haply never had the sight or knowledge one of another, who never entred into agreement of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one with another, is beyond my compasse to conceive, and I suspect any mans ability to explicate and evince.</p>
                        <p>Againe, that persons thus scattered and severed, are wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute according to reason and all rules of the Gospel, of all Church priviledges,</p>
                        <p>I would thus reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They who are in such an estate as that they, nor have, nor can have Church Officers, They are destitute of Church worship, seales, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and so Church Government, and Church Ordinances.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is undeniable. Because according to Presbyterian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, none of all these can be acted or administred without Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But persons thus scattered and severed one from another, can have no Officers.</hi> For those receive their call and right administration, by the joint voice and election of the people now in communion one with another. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Againe,</hi> I conceive it wil be granted (which cannot be denyed) that these particular persons, thus severed, are <hi>membra integrantia</hi> of this Catholike visible Church. And therefore they wholly give being to this Church, but receive no being from it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hence</hi> I cannot see, how this part of the Proposition will stand, with that <hi>conclusion. That the Catholike Church gives part matter, part forme, to the particular Churches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If particular Churches receive their being from the members of the Catholike Church,</hi> (as this proposition affirmes;) <hi>Then</hi> they cannot <hi>receive part matter, and part forme from the Totum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For if <hi>Ecclesia Catholica</hi> give any matter or forme to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, <hi>it gives it by its members.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But it cannot give matter or forme by its members.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Because it received all its being, and so all matter and forme from them, but gave none to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore they can give none from it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These intricate difficulties and twistings of controversie which appeare in Master <hi>Hudsons</hi> frame, keepe me yet that I can give no assent thereunto.</p>

                     <hi>Communion,</hi> according to the nature of the word, <hi>implies ever something common to many, wherein they share by way of proportion, each person according to his condition and place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this is applyed to <hi>severall subjects,</hi> though it requires a <hi>communication</hi> of <hi>something</hi> to <hi>all the subjects,</hi> yet it ever implyes an <hi>appropriation</hi> of that so conveyed <hi>onely to that kind:</hi> whence it is, that as there is a <hi>community</hi> of the thing to all such wherein
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:111062:142"/> this communion lyes, yet there is also a <hi>specification</hi> or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of the subject,</hi> unto which that is conveyed, whereupon it comes, though <hi>all such</hi> have it, yet <hi>none but such</hi> are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it.</p>

                  <p>If by <hi>professed,</hi> he meanes <hi>such a profession</hi> as makes a man a <hi>member ut supra;</hi> this doth yeild the cause, which he would maintaine in appearance, namely, <hi>he that is a member of a Church doth communicate in Church Communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never any denyed this.</p>
                  <p>But if it be the <hi>resolution</hi> of the spirit of a man inwardly (for there <hi>resolution</hi> lyes) and <hi>profession,</hi> outwardly to attend this action of hearing, we then know where to fasten, and we have <hi>two questions</hi> to discusse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether preaching publikely, and publike hearing be a Church action in it selfe considered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this is no Church action, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> yeilds, which indeed is the main scope and hinge of the question, as it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and by dispute agitated betwixt us and them.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>if</hi> Infidels coming in occasionally, once, twice, twenty severall times, to heare, do not yet in so doing communicate in a Church-action: <hi>Then</hi> preaching and hearing do not make a Church-action, in themselves considered. <hi>At primum verum ex concessis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>A bare profession to attend the outward hearing of the word ordinarily, is not a Church action, nor doth infer Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Arguments are,</p>
                  <div n="1" type="argument">

                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That profession, which may stand with the professed opposition and renouncing of the doctrine of the Gospell, and the truth of the Church: That doth not make any Church communion.</hi> For opposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed against the truth of the Doctrine, and truth of the Church-state, is crosse to communion with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But such a profession ordinary may stand with both these.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a Jesuit may be hyred, as an intelligencer, to heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Doctrine to others, who set him on worke to that end: or else as a Caviller to undermine it in the hearts of others whom
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:111062:144"/> he would either draw to Popery, or confirme in Popery. He may be a constant hearer, and yet professe that he hates the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and renounceth the standing of the Churches.</p>

                        <hi>Church communion is ordered by the power of the Church, and they can exercise their power therein:</hi> for what excommunication takes away, that communion of the Church can give.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore it did not give it, by any power of Church worke.</p>
                     <p>We shall now take Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>Arguments</hi> into consideration.</p>
                     <p>Onely we shall crave the Reader to recall two things, (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly evidenced) to mind, and to carry them along in his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and those will help to expedite the <hi>Answer,</hi> to the <hi>reasons</hi> alledged to the contrary.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>That Infidels and Turks may come in occasionally, and yet that hearing is not Church communion,</hi> Lib. 2. p. 270.</item>
                        <item>2. That an <hi>action</hi> in <hi>it selfe</hi> simply considered, may <hi>not be a Church action,</hi> i. e. proper to the Church, yet the <hi>manner</hi> of injoyning this, or injoying of it, in vertue of Church-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is <hi>a Church-worke</hi> and way) issuing from <hi>Church confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy</hi> and combination.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>From these <hi>two premises</hi> now recalled, formerly proved, <hi>It followes,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Preacher may in preaching edify the Church met for that end and convince an <hi>Infidell</hi> coming in occasionally, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24.25. And yet the Infidell doth not joyne in Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, though in hearing the word preached by the Officer of the Church: which is an <hi>Answer to his first Argument.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Infidell may be converted, and so injoy the benefit of the ordinance, and be built upon Christ, at that his occasionall coming, and so joyne in worship with them, and yet not in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:111062:144"/> Church worship, for his own occasionall coming was no Church communion, by Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his own grant, which is an <hi>Answer to his second Argument.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Infidell may be called by others, and being so called, he may come and heare, and partake in the worship, and yet not as <hi>Church hearing or worship,</hi> which is an <hi>Answer to the third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence Church-hearing will be then <hi>Church communion, when by vertue of Church covenant</hi> they put forth Church power in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing, <hi>and persons</hi> in vertue of that relation stand bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in attending to such administrations, and <hi>thus all the members heare.</hi> But the <hi>Infidell</hi> heares upon <hi>another ground</hi> and so shares in the <hi>act,</hi> but is not under the <hi>Church-power</hi> and <hi>manner of the dispensation</hi> of that act: and therefore <hi>his</hi> hearing is not <hi>Church-hearing.</hi> As it is in the meetings of civill Corporations: The members of the Corporation, they come in vertue of the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which they hold by Charter, and so have <hi>Corporation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity:</hi> others come in by the by, as <hi>strangers,</hi> and they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in the <hi>hearing of the Acts</hi> that passe, but not in the <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration community,</hi> in which they have no share: nor hath the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration any power over them, which <hi>Answers the fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence this hearing doth not seperate a visible member <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re notiorum visibilium;</hi> because it belongs to an Infidell also: which <hi>answers</hi> the <hi>fifth Argument.</hi> Nor doth this hearing bring the hearer under any tye, which answers <hi>the sixt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="subsection">
                        <head>From this ground thus laid and made good, <hi>we may collect severall things.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>hearing of</hi> Infidels occasionally argues not <hi>communion of Pastor and people,</hi> betwixt <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>Officer,</hi> that preacheth to him: <hi>Communion betwixt Pastor and flock is Church-communion,</hi> as the termes, and the nature of the relation euidence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But in this</hi> hearing of an Infidell, there is no Church communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ex concessis,</hi> from Master <hi>Rutherford, lib.</hi> 2. 270.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If <hi>this hearing</hi> would make a person of such a flock, and so the Minister his Pastor, <hi>then this</hi> kind of hearing of a wicked and unworthy Minister, would make a man partake with him in that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:111062:145"/> sinfull station of his: which hath ever been accounted irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, in those who have been rigid in their separation, so that it is easy to distinguish betwixt the <hi>word</hi> that is dispensed, in which a hearer communicates, and betwixt the <hi>office</hi> and <hi>stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of him that doth dispense it, with which they onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, who stand in relation to such a one dispensing as their officer.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hence <hi>Church-power and Church-priviledges</hi> are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced in the same act. <hi>Priviledges,</hi> (in my aime here,) imply that good and <hi>benefit</hi> which attends any Church dispensation. As take any <hi>Church act</hi> dispensed, there is. 1. The good <hi>and benifit</hi> which may rise and be received therefrom. 2. <hi>Church like power</hi> in the dispensation thereof. And these <hi>two,</hi> though they goe together, yet are <hi>so differenced</hi> in reality of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the one may be injoyed, I meane the good and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the act, by such who communicate not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. As instance.</p>
                        <p>A man preacheth authoritatively in his congregation. Indians and Turkes, come to heare occasionally, they partake in the <hi>good of the word</hi> and dispensation of it. But not in the <hi>authority</hi> of his ministery. For he is <hi>not a Pastor</hi> to them nor communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with them as a Pastor; as it hath beene formerly from Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> proved.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Hither belong those expressions. 1 Cor 5. &amp; last,</hi> what have we to doe to judge those that are without? <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> let him be to thee as a heathen.</q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore Haethens</hi> come not within the priviledge-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a brother in Church-communion, though they come to Church hearing.</p>
                        <p>And hence it is, as people are more or lesse capable of the good of these dispensations (for so they may be) so they do, and may, partake more or lesse in these priviledges, and yet not in Church power whereby they are dispensed. As it is in some Corporations, some persons of some families, by reason that their predecessors have beene Benefactors to the Charter, they have priviledges to come into the councell of the company, to adventure with them, if they will, and yet have no stroke, by any speciall relation, to act in, or carry on the occasion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe taken up. Thus members of other Churches are capable of more priviledges then those, who are not in that condition: and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:111062:145"/> therefore partake of the benefit of some acts and ordinances, and yet communicate not in the authoritative dispensation of those acts; and this appeares thus.</p>
                        <q>If a Pastor of another congregation hath no authority or power, by his office to require them of another Church, to receive a Sacrament, but they may refuse, if it seeme good to them. Then are they not under his pastorall power to dispense it to them <hi>For by his office power he can require</hi> those <hi>of his own Church to receive it.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>And <hi>if he</hi> hath <hi>no power authoritative</hi> to injoyne them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, they cannot challenge it by any speciall interest they have in that power. For the parity of reason is the same on both sides.</p>
                        <p>That looke, as it was before, when the <hi>Pastors</hi> did preach <hi>authoritatively</hi> in his congregation, he did not onely dispense the word unto his people, as one out of office may doe, but he could by vertue of his office and relation, injoyne them to heare it. They in vertue of their relation to him as a Pastor could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and require it from him. Yet Indians coming in <hi>Obiter,</hi> they partake of the good of the dispensation, but are not under the authoritative power of the dispenser: so that he, by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, could not require them to heare, nor they, by any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive interest to his power, could challenge him to speake to them.</p>
                        <p>And here <hi>then</hi> remember <hi>two things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the <hi>benefit</hi> of the ordinance dispensed and the <hi>power</hi> in the dispensing the Sacrament, are so different, that though the <hi>Pastors</hi> did <hi>dispense it to a member</hi> of <hi>another</hi> congregation, yet he had <hi>no power</hi> to <hi>constraine</hi> him to receive it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Remember, that though a member of another congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is capable of the good of those ordinances (for it is not because a member of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> but <hi>because a member of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> that he becomes capable nextly of these seales) yet he hath no <hi>relative interest</hi> in the power of the dispenser to require it at his hand. And this example will hold proportion with the former, namely. <hi>That persons may partake in Church-priviledges, who doe not partake in Church-power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take this other example.</p>
                        <p>A man provides for his wife, as an husband, such and such diet, and he can require her, out of his authority, to take his
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:111062:146"/> provision. A neighbour coming in may haply share in the like provision, but not upon the like ground. The neighbour as priviledge of speciall neighbourhood. But the wife by the power of her relation, as a wife.</p>
                        <p>So that I cannot see but the proportion is faire. A person may partake of the word authoritatively preached, and yet not communicate with the power and authority of the officer as his. A person may partake of a Sacrament authoritatively dispensed, and yet not communicate with the authority and power of the dispenser. 1. e. as in either, to have relation to him, or them, as their officers.</p>
                        <p>The like may be seene in such acts, which issue from that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive interest which respect the specialty of the covenant of this or that Church. As namely, when members elect, admit, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by vote; The formality of these acts is onely proper to them, yet the good and benefit of all these, they who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, partake of.</p>
                        <p>Instance thus.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a Penitent is to be received into the Church, the members they expresse their readinesse of love, pity, mercy, brotherlinesse to forgive: others also present joyne thus far in that act, as consenting to, and approving of what they doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God: yea are much quickned, comforted, incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged yea taught and instructed by that they heare and see, and so <hi>receive the good,</hi> and are much edified by the ordinance. And yet its that which all men will yeild, they share not, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate not, at all, <hi>in any interest of the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have in the foregoing part of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course enquired, touching the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church, in regard of the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and formall causes of it, and the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall qualifications that attend therupon, in regard of the power and priviledges that appertaine unto it; and thus farre we have looked at it, as <hi>Totum Essentiale;</hi> and yet there is much more required to make up the integrity and perfection thereof, that it may be compleated in all the speciall Members and Officers, which the Lord Christ hath appointed and set in this visible body of his, for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the speciall operation of every part, and the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it selfe in love, <hi>Ephe</hi> 4.13, 16.</p>
               <p>And thus the Church becomes <hi>Corpus Orgenicum,</hi> A body or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized of such prime and choice members, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the beauty and building of the body in that intirenesse that it may grow up to an holy temple in the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:111062:147"/>
               <p>As we looke at <hi>Sampson,</hi> when he was deprived of his eyes, as a man still, to whom the ful definition of man did fully agree, <hi>est animal rationale,</hi> as a living creature endued with a reasonable soul. But consider him in the integrity or intirenes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as consisting of body and souls, and that body made up of such members, as eyes, head, hands, such as are integrall to the whole: We say then, though he be a true man, yet he is not an intire man, but lame and mamed, destitute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of some of those parts, that conduce to the perfection of his integrity.</p>
               <p>It is so here, A Church without Officers is a true Church, in regard of the essence of it: There is a company or society of visible Saints confoederate toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>her in the profession of the faith of the Gospell. But it is not compleat, but lame and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in regard of the integrity of it.</p>
               <p>The Lord Christ therefore hath provided for the perfection of his Church in this behalfe also; it is a coronation gift which he bestoweth upon his Spouse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. when he had conquered the enemies of our salvation by his death and obedience, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over them in his resurrection, and now returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne countrey, ascending into the highest heavens, and sits crowned with majesty and glory at the right hand of the Father, he gave gifts, gave <hi>some to be Apostles, some Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, some Prophets;</hi> those extraordinary, because there was extraordinary use of them; for the first planting and watering of the churches: He gave also some to bee Pastors, some Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the gathering of the Saints the work of ministery, building the body of Christ.</p>
               <p>And though the chiefe aime and scope of our Saviour (under the glory of his name,) was to provide for the speciall good of his elect; yet because those his elect were mingled here with the wicked in the world, nay many an elect child proceeds of a reprobate parent, and because it is impossible for the eye of man to search into heart secrets, and inward sincerity which is covered there; but must judge of men, and dispence ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to men according to the lawes and limites of rationall charity; therefore it is that our Saviour hath bestowed these offices as a royall gift upon the visible Church over whom (as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111062:147"/> we have heard) he is a head Politicall, by outward guidance and government, as well as a head mysticall by his speciall and spirituall conveyance of his grace. The consideration of the Nature, Institution, and operations of Officers, hath a constraining power to conclude this truth beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The invisible Church, and all that is comprehendad within that notion, is to be believed, is not lyable to our eye, nor comes to be discerned visibly.</p>
               <p>But for the Officers of the Church, which are now standing and ordinary, there is required a visible company of people, that must concurre and consent to call them: The persons must be tried and approved, (and <hi>ergo</hi> visible) that must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. God sets ordinary Officers in his Church, but it is by man, and therefore he must know them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Look at their Ordination, when they are called.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Look at their Dispensation and exercise of their places and power, in preaching the word, in administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and censures.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Look at the parties which are offenders who must be censured, or penitent, who must be received again.</p>
               <p>All these operations proclaim a visibility on all parts and in all the particular circumstances.</p>
               <p>Which is the rather to be observed; because when we read or meet with such expressions in Scriptures which intimate either the call or institution of Ministers, or any of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, we may know, they do belong unto the visible Church, and are to be attended in that relation and respect.</p>
               <p>For common sence will constrain a man to confesse, that there must be visible persons, who must exercise keyes in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning: and there must be visible persons that must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
               <p>What the word of the Gospell hath revealed concerning these Officers may be referred to those particular heads, and thus laid out unto our view.</p>

               <p>We see the frame, we shall attend the particulars, as they are propounded in their order.</p>
               <p>Touchi g the Number of these Officers, generally two things are to be attended.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>Whether beside these five appointed by Christ, any more can lawfully be added, or should be tolerated?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No, in no wise; the rule is here sure, from which we must not depart, no not a haires breadth: thou shalt adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereunto, take nothing there-from.</p>
                  <p>That which our Saviour inquired, and the Scribes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, touching <hi>Johns</hi> ministery, it is true of all these orders and Ordinances, They are from heaven. The Lord Christ is the giver and alone Institutor of them, and none beside, and this is evidenced; 1. From the right of giving, whence these proceed. When our Saviour ascended, He led captivity captive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that conquers the countrey, to him it appertains to set rulers over it, and over his subjects in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They are especiall meanes of Gods worship, and all of them in rise and end have an eye to spirituall things, and spirituall operations, though they be employed in ordinary outward things, as the Offices of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and widows are appointed by Christ to provide for the state and health of the members: that the love of Christ, as the Head of his Church, might thereby be observed, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of those who are refreshed thereby, may be more full and enlarged to serve him with a glad heart, in a Church way, and in the improvement of all Ordinances to that end: and all other civill provisions, though good in their kind, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain this end, without the Ordinances of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.1.2.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:111062:148"/>3 Its affirmed by the Apostle, touching two sorts of them, the Pastor and the Teacher, whose imployment is principally about labouring in the Word, that they are for the perfecting of the body, untill we all meet in the unity of the faith, and the fulnesse of the stature in Christ: so that they are able to attain this end, and that in all ages untill the full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gathering in of all the Saints; and therefore there needs no more to be added, to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore the usurpation of that man of sinne, when he ascended upon high, to the Popes chaire, and to be Head of the Church, that he gave some to be Surrogates, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Deanes, Arch deacons for the building up of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darknesse; because he easily perceived, that Christs Officers would never do his work kindly, nor further his kingdome, but he must have his own creatures, which must be at his beck, and stand, <hi>durante beneplacito;</hi> and therefore must be forced to do his drudgery, and durst do no other, unlesse they should be flung away, if the man of sinne did but once frown upon them.</p>
                  <p>That as God complains of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> practice, when he would maintain his faction, and preserve the people from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their King, He set up false worship; because he concluded, the truth of the word and worship attended unto would make them look unto their true King; and to keepe them in false worship, he provides false teachers; made the lowest of the people priests, who because they had no call and appointment from God, never had care to preserve his word or worship, but to maintain that course of religion, whereby they were maintained in their places.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as God said of them, he will say of these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Orders, They never came into his mind or heart.</p>
                  <p>Not come from Heaven, but from the bottomlesse pit, and therefore ought not to be admitted, nor yet tollerated; but being plants which the Lord hath not planted, they should be plucked up.</p>
                  <p>Whom God never calls, God never blesseth.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be observed, that these Orders have beene the props and pillars of that Kingdome of darknesse, and have been the brokers and maintainers of all that hideous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which hath beene vented in the doctrines and opinions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111062:149"/> that have acted in the lives and conversations of that hellish crew that have had their dependance upon the man of sinne.</p>
                  <p>And it is marvelous dangerous to bring in, or continue the least alteration from the minde of Christ in any thing.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> complaines bitterly, that a constant Moderator made way for a Bishop, and so for the bane of their Churches. Christ who is the King and Head of his Church and House, hee in reason should appoint his under-Officers, and such as he best knowes, suits the occasions of the Family, and will best provide for the good thereof, and his own content.</p>

                  <p>The other thing in generall to be observed, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they must be kept distinct;</hi> and that according to the mind and intendment of our Saviour one person must not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ingrosse all, nor severall of these together.</p>
                  <p>As to be Ruling Elder and Pastour, or one and the same man to be Elder and Deacon.</p>
                  <p>For it is apparent by the Apostle his discourse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. that they are put in way of opposition, as <hi>Membra dividentia,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Apostles comparison carries this with it, as the maine thing intended therein. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. As there be many members in the body, but all the members have not one and the same office. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is therefore wide to say, as Mr. <hi>R. that this comparison holdeth not in all:</hi> because it must hold in the very thing that is intended, yea specified; for this is the hinge upon which the comparison turnes, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. and the ground of the Apostle his inference, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. If the Apostles professed, they could not attend tables, and attend Word and Prayer, and therefore laid aside the one, that they might discharge the other; who shall thinke hee is sufficient for many of these?</p>
                  <p>The reasons that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> alledgeth, doe not satisfie.</p>

                     <q>1. The Apostles did exercise both, as they could, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Auditory was.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The Apostles were extraordinary persons, and were fitted and assisted answerably, which none, whose calling is ordinary, must looke for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they had all offices virtually in themselves, and did put forth acts of all, as it appeares before the choice of the Deacons: But if any now shall thinke himselfe able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe two of them, the profession of the Apostles and their practise also will be a reall confutation of them; since they so assisted, saw reason to lay downe one, that they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the other, none will dare to take up both, unlesse hee will presume he hath greater both sufficiencie and ability, then the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> saith, That the formall Objects, to wit, the information of the Judgement, and exhorting, are not so different, as that they should be incompatible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> These, in themselves and full bredth, are not so incompatible; But look at the specialty of the gift, that fits for the one, and that which furnisheth for the other. 2. To attend mainly and chiefly upon each, according to the gift, they will prove inconsistent.</p>
                  <p>To have a speciall gift for the one, and to bestow himselfe upon that, and to have a speciall gift for the other, and to bestow himselfe upon that also, will ever be found, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to attaine, yet ever disadvantagious to the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospell. And a mans owne experience will evidence as much to him, if he will attend it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it sufficient that one is eminent in the gift, which fits the Ruling-Elder, or Deacon; yet that gives no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he may be Doctor, Ruler, and Deacon.</p>
                  <p>But look where a mans spirit is best fitted, if once called to that worke, he must let all the stream and strength of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties run in that channell, lest being divided into many, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fit for none, and failes in all.</p>
                  <p>This may suffice for the number.</p>

                           <hi>That there is such an Office and Officer</hi> appointed by Christ, as the Scriptures are plaine to him, whose spirit and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is not prepossest and forestalled with prejudice: So this cause hath beene maintained by many of Christs Worthies of former, and now of latter times; and now at last, by those two famous and eminent Champions, Mr. <hi>Rutterfort,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gilespy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that we have no controversie here but with Hierarchicall Persons, the force and power of whose Arguments, lies especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Pursuvant and a Prison, armed with Authority of an High-Commission.</p>

                        <p>The first Argument we have from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. which gives in witnesse to this truth; where all these Officers are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and named expresly; if the meaning of the words bee once manifested, which will bee made cleare in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following:</p>

                        <p>First, those gifts are here meant, by which the members of the Body of Christ are distinct one from another, and have severall acts appropriated to them, as <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>So that Prophecie and Ministery are here put as common heads, unto which the rest may be referred, and under which they are ranged, and that's the reason why the Apostle in this enumeration changeth his phrase: The 1.

                        <p>So that it is a meere conceit, that carries not the weight of a feather with it, of such, who say that <hi>Paul</hi> intended to see
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111062:151"/> downe the severall functions in the Church: then there should be seven, not five, making Prophecie and Ministery two, when these are not distinct <hi>species,</hi> but two generall heads, unto which the particulars were referred.</p>
                        <p>Hence we reason.</p>
                        <p>That function and office in the Church, which differs so from all the rest, as one member of the body distinct from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in actions appropriate to it selfe, that is properly a distinct <hi>species</hi> or kind from them.</p>
                        <p>But the function of a Ruler doth so differ from all other Offices in the Church, as the members of the body doe in the actions appropriate to them.</p>

                        <p>The second Argument is taken from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. God hath set some in his Church; as first, Apostles; then Prophets; thirdly, Teachers; after that Powers, then gifts of healing, helps, Governments.</p>
                        <p>The scope of the place, and Apostle his intendment is, to lay open the severall Offices and Officers that the Lord hath set in his Church, and so many chiefe members out of which the Church is constituted as an intire body.</p>
                        <p>And for the right discovery of the Apostles proceeding and purpose, we may observe:</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="3">3. Though some extraordinary persons had some of these gifts virtually, and put forth the operations thereof, as the Apostles, they wrought miracles, spake with tongues; yet that hinders not, but these gifts might formally be in some subjects, as appointed of purpose by Christ, for that kinde of imployment: As some only spake with tongues, some only had the gift of Healing.</p>
                        <p>And it is most apparent in some of the particulars, though the Apostles did prophesie and teach, yet Prophets and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were speciall functions appropriate to some men, so also were Deacons; and therefore also it hinders not, but Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments might be a speciall kinde of Rulers, distinct from Teachers.</p>
                        <p>From which premises, the dispute issues thus:</p>
                        <p>As Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers are distinct, so are Helps and Governments distinct; for the Spirit puts them in the same ranke, as having a parity of reason, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to them all.</p>
                        <p>But they were distinct Officers, and found in persons as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Officers, as <hi>vers.</hi> 30. Are all Apostles? Are all Teachers? Therefore the same is true of Governours.</p>

                        <p>A third Argument is taken from that famous place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. which is full to our purpose in hand, and intended by the holy Spirit of the Lord, to make evident the station and office of Ruling-Elders unto the end of the world; and it is admirable to observe, how the factors and followers of the Pope and the Prelates, who labour to prop up their place and pre-eminencie, have used all the wilinesse of their wits, and unweariable wrestlings of their carnall reason, to darken the evidence of the truth, and to defeat the power of the proofe in the place, as fearing, it should seeme, lest by this meanes, their way to promote and maintaine the pride of the Prelacy, would be utterly prejudiced and overthrowne; whereas, doe but suffer the Deacon to lay aside the care of the poore, make him but halfe a Priest, give him the allowance that hee may baptize, and not give the Sacrament of the Supper; raise the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111062:152"/> Ruling-Elder one staire higher, that he may be a Teaching-Presbyter: By this time, the Bishop is beyond the bound of an ordinary Elder, and with a little helpe, he will be handed up into a Diocoesan Palace, and one lift more will make him a Primate; and if the Kings of the earth favour him, hee will make himselfe a Pope presently; for they differ but in degrees, not in kinde.</p>
                        <p>So that you must not wonder to see the contention grow so hot touching a Ruling-Elder, because if hee be confined within his compasse, the wings of Pope and Prelate will bee exceedingly clipped, and their power impeached.</p>
                        <p>Its not suitable to our purpose to contend with all cavills, nor shall wee need‚ñ™ for they have beene confuted long before this day, and that by such who have beene furnished with choyce abilities to this purpose; I shall therefore satisfie my selfe to give the native and naturall sense of the words, as suits onely to the rules of right and reason, and may bee easie to such (as the wayes of wisdome are) who are willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
                        <p>The forme of the context stands thus:</p>
                        <p>When the Apostle, in the foregoing verses, had directed to the right choice of the Widow, whose labour should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the Church, he intimates also his minde, how she should be respected by the Church, in whose service she is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: <hi>Honour Widowes, &amp;c. v.</hi> 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> so care for them, that they may be sufficiently supplyed, according to their care and condition.</p>
                        <p>And from thence he takes occasion to leave an Apostolicall Canon upon Record, how the Elders of the Churches should be provided for: To wit, the lowest degree of Rulers are worthy, not single and sufficient supply of Widowes, but <hi>double honour,</hi> the certaine put for the uncertaine, the finite for the infinite (by a <hi>synechdoche) i. e.</hi> all honourable respect, <hi>Officium &amp; beneficium,</hi> not onely sufficient to relieve their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, but that which may honourably answer their places, imployments, and prayers.</p>
                        <p>But the Elders that are of the highest ranke, and whose place requires laboriousnesse in Word and Doctrine, they may most especially challenge, and the Church ought especially to bestow this <hi>double honour</hi> upon them.</p>

                        <p>And it is especially to be observed, their workes are not the things compared, but the persons notified by the kind of their works: For the words are not, The Elders, because they rule well, and because they labour,</p>

                        <p>And hence those conceits vanish: namely,</p>
                        <p>Elders here are not attended for their private conversation in holinesse, as though to rule well, was to order themselves well in a Christian course.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, nor will the conceit hold, which saith, There be not divers Elders, but divers workes of one Elder attended; when <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>Now its well known, its required that both parts of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete axiome, be not only discrete, but true in themselves.</p>
                        <p>Whence againe, that conceit utterly vanisheth, which makes the comparison to ly betwixt the two acts of one man, namely, The well ruling of a Pastor is worthy of double honour, be it alone in it self considered, which is an assertion grossely crosse to the rule of divinity, as the former was to the rule of logick. That interpretation which makes the performance of the least part of a Pastoral calling, though it be with the neglect of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111062:153"/> greatest work, worthy double honour; that is grossely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of God, and the verdict of the Scriptures. For <hi>cursed be the man that doth the work of the Lord negligently,</hi> and <hi>wo to me, if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> Rather a double wo is to be denounced against them, then double honour bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                        <p>But this interpretation doth this. Or thus I may reason</p>
                        <p>If the Apostle, in this text, doth not speak only of Elders preachers, then he speaks of Elders no preachers.</p>
                        <p>But the first is true, he speaks in the place of some Elders no preachers, which is thus proved.</p>
                        <p>f he speaks only of preachers, then were there some preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who preached not at all. But there no be Preachers who preached not at all.</p>
                        <p>The second part is past deniall. The consequence is proved.</p>
                        <p>If those Elders who are most worthy of double honour are said but to labour in the word: then they who are accounted but worthy of it, did not labour in the word.</p>
                        <p>But those Elders or Preachers, that by the Apostle are counted most worthy, are said but to labour in the Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> to preach. <hi>ergo</hi> they who are but worthy, did not preach at all.</p>
                        <p>Lastly the Bishops factors, who take up this defence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ill for the honour and pomp of their great Lords, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prelates of the world.</p>
                        <p>For by the Apostles peremtory determination, the meanest Minister that is conscientious and laborious in preaching, should have more honourable respect, then the Diocoesan, who sits in his Cathedrall, and under the name of ruling, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth over the poore people, but labours not to feed them with the word of life.</p>
                        <p>To the evidence of the text, we may adde the testimonie of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which carries an amazing kind of manifestation and discovery with it.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 Let him know then, that the Elders mentioned by <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> were such, that their places and Offices were almost worn out, and laid aside in most of the Churches in his time.</p>
                        <p>But that the Office of preaching Elders was not. <hi>Ergo</hi> those Elders were not such.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the defacing of the power and rule of these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it came as he conjectures, partly by the idlenesse, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the pride of Teachers, because they alone might be lifted up. <hi>Ergo</hi> these Elders could not be Teachers: for those Teachers laboured to destroy the place and power of these Elders; but it is against all shew of reason, nay against common sense to say or think, That these Elders should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their own places.</p>
                        <p>Again, The Teachers that would darken &amp; abolish the place of these Elders, it is said, their aim was to make themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone eminent.</p>
                        <p>They who would make themselves alone eminent by the disanulling of the honour of others places, they could not be such who were of that rank, or did possesse any of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                        <p>Before the Assemlby, when there is any emergent occasion of weight or difficultie which concerns the congregation; the Ruling Elder is as one of the common councell, the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of whose judgement, his voice and verdict, is to be taken in with the others, in the consultation and consideration of the businesse, for they are all leaders, all Governours, all watchmen, in this common work, and <hi>ergo</hi> must have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon influence of counsel, as the concernment of the Church shall require. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
                        <p>When offences are publick, or private cannot be cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be brought to the congregation, It belongs to them all by way of preconsideration, and preparation, to ripen the occasions, that all the doubtfull or perplexed circumstances that might trouble the body, or either cause any mistake in such as be weak, or mislead any through misunderstanding, all such mists by through search must be removed, the particulars cleared, the cause punctually and plainly stated, that the understanding of the meanest in the congregation may be able to discern, when the businesse is propunded, where the pinch lies, and so to passe sentence answerably.</p>
                        <p>The Church must be told, but by an orderly way; and they

The members of the Church, when under the exercise of Gods hand they become to be exercised with any spirituall wants, as in time of sicknesse, because of the pressure of the disease, and the grief and weight thereof, or their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they are not able to pray for themselves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. they are then injoyned <hi>to send for ehe Elders:</hi> not that it was unlawfull for them to come, before they be sent for, if the sick be in a low and wearish condition and not able to pray for themselves, but because either the Elders happily do not know of their necessities, or yet not know the time and opportunity when it may be most seasonable to repair to them: <hi>ergo</hi> its most meet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And by the same parity and proportion of reason, if any want comfort, sinking under discouragement and sadnesse of spirit, or through ignorance are not able to understand the things delivered, they may call for the help of the Elder in private, that they may be informed and comforted by him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 And hence it followes that he hath power to inquire of the condition, and take account of the speciall state of such of the members: for else how should he be able to administer

                        <p n="5">5 To him it is, that such as are willing to joyn with the congregation, should repair and expresse their desire. He is by vertue of his place, to take speciall consideration of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and conditions, and if he find no just impediment to ly in the way, he is to bring their names and desires to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as in his wisdome he sees fit, according to God, and to lead the whole assembly in the work of their admission, by presenting them to triall, calling for their allowance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation by vote. And it seems to us, to follow from hence, that in case the censure of Excommunication is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, it appertains to him to lead the action, and pronounce the sentence: because there is parity of reason: he that ruled the action of admissions and receiving into the Church, to him it appertains to lead and dispence the act of excommunication or casting out; and the argument that forceth and fastens all those services upon him, as his peculiar charge, is this,</p>
                        <p>What ever doth not belong to labouring in word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and is not a common act of rule, those actions belong to him that rules well. But all these acts now specified are such. And in truth, the nature of the things would easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a mans reason to yield thereunto. For how inequall and unreasonable would it seem to a man acquainted with the weight and work of the ministery, that when the Pastor or Teacher should be attending upon reading, and searching the sense and mind of God in the word, and the mysteries of God therein, (who is sufficient for such things?) that they should
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111062:155"/> be then taken off their studies, &amp; be forced to attend upon mens speciall weaknesses or wants in private, when they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the publick dispensations, so that the one must be of necessity neglected, or they distracted in both? whereas this appointment of our Saviour provides for both, without any prejudice or disadvantage to either.</p>

                     <p>We have done with the Office of the Ruling Elder. That which presents it self next to our consideration is the Office of the Pastor, and then the Teacher.</p>
                     <p>The limits of the Pastors work, may be thus laid out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes of Christs institution. The scope of his Office is to work upon the will and the affections, and by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, powerfull, and affectionate application of the truth delivered, to chase it into the heart, to wooe and win the soul to the love and liking, the approbation and practise of the doctrine which is according to godlinesse, and hence he that exhorts is injoyned to attend upon exhortation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.

This is called a word of wisdome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. because it is a point of speciall prudence, and that in the greatest excellency of it, how to come within the bosome of a finner, and grapple so powerfully with his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he may take no nay at his hand.</p>
                     <p>He that wins souls is wise <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. and therefore his labour is to lay open the lothsome nature of sinne, and to let in the terrour of the Lord upon the conscience, that the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and rebellious sinner may come to a parley of peace, and be content to take up the profession of the truth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when he hath so done, either his hypocrisie may carry him aside from Christ, or discouragement may make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to come to the Lord Jesus, <hi>ergo</hi> his wisdom and work

                     <p>Beside in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. when the Apostle doth on purpose set himself to record the severall Officers appointed by our Saviour, he puts this by way of division, and opposition unto the other: only I find some difference in the apprehensions of interpreters, touching the nature and work of the Teachers amongst themselves. Many and those of exact judgement, seem to consine him to the School, (with whom under favour) I cannot so fully agree: I should rather conceive, Doctour may be attended with some distinction.</p>

                     <p>In this second sense we understand the Officer we now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, and that wherein he shares in common with the Pastor is, that they have both of them Authority and right delegated from Christ to consecrate and to administer the Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>Hee who hath office-power to publish the Covenant of Grace, hee by the same office may administer the seales of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But they both may out of Office-power and Authority, preach the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>When I say preach out of Authority of Office, I so speake, because as we have formerly disputed, Brethren, who are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, may, as occasion shall require, and they invited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, preach, or publikely open the Scripture, to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hearer, and yet not doe it out of office.</p>
                     <p>Look what office-power authorizeth to the dispensation of the Covenant; the same, upon the same right, will authorize to the administration of the Seales. But the peculiar things appropriate to his place, are;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The aime and scope of the Doctor is, to informe the judgement, and to help forward the work of illumination, in the minde and understanding, and thereby to make way for the truth, that it may be setled and fastned upon the heart; and is therefore injoyned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. to <hi>attend unto Teaching:</hi> Not that it is not lawfull for him to administer a word of exhortation, as it were by the way: But he dwells not upon that, that is not his maine worke, bestowes neither his studies nor his strength upon it, as his chiefe businesse, and therefore <hi>a word of knowledge</hi> is said to be given to him. Hence all such dispensations, which doe properly and immediately conduce to this end, doe belong in an especiall manner to him.</p>
                     <p>As to dwell upon the interpretation of the Text, so farre as the difficulty and intricacie thereof may require, and to cleare it to the capacity of the meanest, because this is necessary to the information of the judgement.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To him it appertaines to lay down a <hi>Platforme of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words,</hi> and to deliver the fundamentall points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111062:157"/> Faith, the principles of Religion, as the maine pillars of truth, which may under-prop our apprehensions, that they may not be carried aside with every wind of Doctrine, because this is necessary to the teaching.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To him it belongs to handle such controversies as are on foot, and doe arise betwixt the Church and Adversaries of the truth, to state them clearely, strongly, and solidly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them out of the Word, and to convince such as bee the broachers and maintainers of them, because this is necessary for the information of the judgement.</p>
                     <p>Other things might be added, but these are the principall.</p>
                     <p>The controversie which hath exercised the world since that man of sinne was advanced into the chayre of Ambition, and falls in here, is;</p>

                     <p>A Bishop by divine Institution is such an Officer, which Christ hath set in his Church, and whose Office is set forth and discovered in the Word, and such are Pastors and Doctors, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Humanus</hi> is a President or constant Moderator, chosen by consent of Ministers, meeting and consulting about the affaires of their Churches in their common consociations, to whom it appertained, to moderate the actions of the Assembly, to propound things to be agitated, to gather voyces, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111062:157"/> the sentence which passed by common approbation; and he had no more, but his equall suffrage with the rest, and when his action was ended, was but in equall honour with the rest; nay, may be, in lesse respect, in regard of yeares or gifts.</p>
                     <p>In consociations, reason and order forceth such a kinde of proceeding: For should all interpose in the fore-named acts, it would breed a disturbance and confusion in all.</p>
                     <p>Onely to impose and leave it constantly upon one man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which is past gain-saying, hath made it appear to be perilous, and to be indeed an in-let to worse inconveniences, then at the first could have been suspected. Prevent then that irregularity of fixing such an imployment constantly upon one, there is nothing of such a course, but may bee tollerated in consociations, where persons by mutuall agreement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre for to help with common concurrence of counsell, as emergent occasions shall require.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Satanicus</hi> is such an <hi>Episcopus,</hi> which the enemy Satan, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pride, and suiting the Soveraignty of the spirits of men, hath by a mysterious way successively and secretly brought into the Church, that so he might Mid-wife Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ into the world, this being the next step to that man of sinne: And he becomes <hi>princeps Episcopus,</hi> who by his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie hath arrogated and assumed, and at last confirmed even a Monarchicall power unto himselfe.</p>
                     <p>And however the Pope, who is the universall Bishop, is the man of sinne, yet the Bishop, especially when he is ascended to his Arch-Bishops Chaire, is the same, but onely considered in his minority, as the childe of sinne, or the man of sinne in his child-hood.</p>
                     <p>For laying aside the ranknesse of those extravagancies of the Popes temporall power, or that power in temporalities; It will appeare his power in <hi>spiritualibus</hi> is of the same kinde: for he assumes a peerelesse power to himselfe; that look what the King is to his Councell, he takes them to himselfe in way of consultation, but the finall determination and resolution lyes in his owne bosome: So the Bishop is to his inferiour Clergy: He will heare them speake, when he pleaseth to give allowance, but it is in his owne breast, to cast the ballance, which way seemes best to himselfe: So <hi>Downam, Bilson,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111062:158"/> Saravia;</hi> whence he appropriates to himselfe to bee <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Judex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is sole Rector, and therefore Ministers cannot put forth any Act of their owne order, without his leave; and therefore if the Lord Bishop be in place, the poore Priest must not preach, nor pray, nor administer, if his great Master will officiate the work, which (as hap is) they doe not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the world witball, if it be matter of work.</p>
                     <p>Hee counts himselfe the sole Pastor, they are onely his <hi>Subsidiarii,</hi> who come onely in <hi>partem sollicitudinis,</hi> but share not in <hi>plenitudine potestatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence he is <hi>sole Judex,</hi> by whom all are to be censured with punishments of suspensions, depositions, degradations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications: But the Scripture ownes no such Officer, but he is a meer humane creature; nay, an invention hatched by Satan, warmed in the wombe of pride, selfe-Soveraignty, covetousnesse, untill the monstrous birth of Antichrist came abroad into the world.</p>
                     <p>Our reasons against this usurped Order are these of many: 1. The expresse testimony of the Scripture, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more pregnant, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7. The Apostle having injoyned his Scholler <hi>to appoint Elders in every City,</hi> and how they must bee qualified, hee addes the reason of his advice, <hi>For a Bishop must be blamelesse,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Its not a matter of liberty or curtesie which may be done or left undone: but it is a duty and a work of justice, unto which the Church is called, and to the performance whereof they are bound in conscience. Provision in this kind is wages and not benevolence. So our Saviour concludes (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.10.) touching his disciples, when he sent them to preach: he bids them not to be sollicitous for relief, <hi>For the workman is worthy of his wages.</hi> And the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it by the verdict of all Lawes. Look we at the Law of nature; <hi>We must not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the

                           <hi>This provision should be so honourable and comfortable</hi> as that it may attain the end for the which it was appointed by God, &amp; so collected by the people, and given to the Ministers. The end (as is above intimated) that the Officers might employ their time and strength, and study, for the work of the Lord, and that freely, and fully. Hence therefore this provision should be such as might take off all care and distraction in a rationall proceeding, that they should have no need to be stow either thoughts or care, travell or expence of time, which was either fit or needfull to be imployed to make preparation for the publick, or to bestow themselves upon the private necessities of the members of the Church, as their occasions or the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers duties should require. Thus the Levites were in the Old Testament. Thus the Apostle chargeth also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.18. And if they must not intangle them elves in the businesses of this life: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Church must not be an occasion they should: and this is one thing aimed at, in that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Elders are worthy of double honour,</hi> yea they must be given to hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore they must have such supply, as that they may not provide for their own comforts only for present, and lay in for this in a faithfull way of Providence, but that they may be able to give comfortable entertainment to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as opportunity shall be offered.</p>

                           </gap>; <hi>i. e. All good things</hi> that are communicable, for some things are such as admit no communication; such as a man lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot, so he should not make them common.</p>
                        <p>As a man hath one roome to lodge in, one servant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, one coat to cover his nakednesse; onely so much provision as will supply his owne necessities, these cannot be made common. But what ever good things hee may make common, if he have for himself and to spare, he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, according to his place, portion and proportion.</p>
                        <p>Some good things are common to all or most of the body.</p>
                        <p>Other good things appertaine to some few.</p>
                        <p>In all there must be a communication; as if they have Land, Lots, Meddowes, Cattell, &amp;c. so must the body provide for them; So provisions for cloathing, dyet, or any choice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that God casts in occasionally, which may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, they should even of those specialls communicate.</p>

                        <p>The Text gives an expresse answer; <hi>every one</hi> that is taught, whether Servant or Master, bond or free, rich or poore; yea, though in other cases he receive contribution, yet when, or wherein God betrusts him with any good thing, wherein hee may communicate, and if he finde the Word powerfull, hee will be provoked to doe it; and against this I know no judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and pious Divine, un lesse it be such who are taken up too much with a tang of a Popish and Jewish way of Tything. However they may, and doe happily adde somewhat more, yet the Text hath that native and naturall evidence, that it will like a mighty current, carry any consciencious man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it. Upon this ground laid, I shall take leave to adde severall things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This way of maintenance is most safe, and certainly in the times of the Gospel most suitable to the minde of God, having the expresse testimony of the truth for warrant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that recorded with such evidence as cannot be waved or questioned. This maintenance is sufficient, and abundantly satisfactory to answer the worke that is done, and the end to which it is given. That which makes the portion and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Ministers, to carry some kind of proportion to the plenty and variety of all the good things of all those with

                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:111062:162"/> whom they live; That way of raising maintenance makes it honourable and comfortable. But this doth so, because not onely many, but all, bring in something of all they have either in their constant possession, or what they can occasionally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, or God in his providence casts in. And here there is a latitude given to divers apprehensions. Some conceive (the Lords Treasury, being committed to the Deacons, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all Tables of Officers, and the Tables of the poor, both its owne and others.) That this Treasury should be furnished every Lords day by the free-wil offerings of the Assembly, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one casting into it, as God hath blessed him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. They also conceive this rule of <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. may be attended in this way, every one bringing in of all their good things in a <hi>proportionable value,</hi> as may suite the occasions of the Church. Others againe conceive, that the maintenance mentioned in the fore-going place cannot be fully raised by a treasury common to the poore and Ministers, nor can it be gathered upon the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion hath two parts: First, That this way of maintenance cannot be raised fully by a treasury common to the poore and Ministers, out of which supply unto them both should be fetched.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To such a Treasury all should not pay: But to this all do, for all are instructed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thus to provide is appropriate to the Minister, and to him alone. For of him alone it is said, <hi>let him that teacheth be made partaker of all our good things;</hi> let no man else; not the poore. That which is put into a common treasury, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, who must be so relieved. But the poore are not to be relieved by all our good things; nor doth either rule or reason lead us, or allow us so to doe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If all our good things cannot be put into the Treasury, which yet by the word wee cannot but bestow upon our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, then this providing for Officers must not wholly and only be confined to the treasury. For experience tels, there be many of our good things thus to be given to our Teachers which cannot be put into a Treasury.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 This coupling of the poore and Ministers in one common Treasury confounds the works of Justice and Mercy. For the poore who are to be relieved out of mercy, they share in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111062:162"/> contributions which are put in, out of a just recompence of wages to the Ministers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 And upon the same ground they conceive that this way of maintenance cannot be fully raised upon the Sabbath, because there be severall good things cast in by way of Providence, which we should bestow upon our Officers. And happily they cannot be kept untill the Sabbath, nor will it be comely to give them in, in that place, and at that time. These be the different apprehensions of differing brethren; but all agree in this, that an honourable and comfortable maintenance is a due debt. <hi>It should be no breach of love, that each Church follow her own light herein.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3 In case any member shall fail in this free contribution, he sinnes in a breach of the known rule of the Gospell: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the Church, to see the Reformation of that evill, as of any other scandall; and therfore if there be any doubt or difficulty arising, how it may be regulated in any such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the Church is according to God to determine it, and the Deacons according to such a determination, are to seek the execution of it; and because it is better to prevent a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>That this way</hi> of raising maintenance, appointed in the Gospell, is far differing from that way of tithing in the Law, nay to be tyed precisely to follow the one, cannot stand with the other, for this is raised out of all good things, the person that is taught hath: but those Tithes in the Old Testament <hi>were out of the seed of the land, the fruit of the trees, or of the herd of the flock,</hi> Levi. 27.30.31.32. Deut. 14.22.23.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>This maintenance</hi> is to be paid by all that are <hi>taught:</hi> But the Levites were to receive the first tenth, and pay the tenth of the tenth unto the Priest, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.38. So that if the patrons of tithing look at the command given to the Jew, as a morall law, they must confine themselves precisely to the prescript form thereof, <hi>ergo</hi> the Ministers must have the tenth of a tenth, and from them hapily who were never taught by them. As
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111062:163"/> the Levites who taught in the particular Synagogues paid to the Priest who administred in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That the way of tithing in the Old Testament was not a naturall nor morall law; For no law appointed in the Gospell, is inconsistent with any naturall or morall Law of God, which this is, as hath immediately been proved.</p>

                     <p>We have done with those Offices, and Officers, which look at the whole Church, and whose dispensations meerely and immediately reach the speciall good of the soul: But the Lord Christ, as a King of infinite mercy as well as wisdome, he provides for the outward good and comfort of all his houshold and subjects, in regard of their estates, that they may be maintained, and their health also, and so their lives preserved in a prosperous condition, and to this end he hath appointed Officers, that should in a peculiar manner look to the Church, and so provide for the good of both.</p>
                     <p>The Office that is to look to, and relieve the Estates of such as are commended to their care, is the Office of Deacons, of which we shall inquire: First, their Name: secondly, their Office, as it is distinct from the rest: thirdly, the bounds wherein their duties ought to be confined.</p>

                     <p>Where observe, 1. There were many Bishops in one Church, not one over many.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That amongst these there was no Metropolitan, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Arch-Bishop. For then <hi>Paul</hi> had been much to blame, in passing him by, or omitting his title and due remembrance.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. But lastly, when it is taken most strictly, and as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our purpose in hand, it sets out such officers, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by the Church to dispose the state &amp; treasure thereof to those severall pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">I. That this is a distinct office in the Church, severall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give in undeniable evidence: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He that distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi> Here the Apostle reckons these, as a distinct kinde, from those that went before.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It being the Apostle his aime, by a similitude drawn from the body, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to discover severall parts by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were in a peculiar manner appropriate to them. As there be many members in the body, and all have not one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or action: so in the Church there be many members, but there be severall offices appropriate to them.</p>
                     <p>Whereas, was this a Christian duty common to all, the Apostle should overthrow his owne purpose: For he should have shewed things agreeing to all alike, when he should have shewen that some things are peculiar</p>
                     <p>Obje. <hi>If it be said that this was done before, and now he comes to set forth such dutyes as appertaines to all.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The words of the text bear down that conceit.

                     <p>The acts are so generall, that the Reader should not misse the aime of the Spirit, if he would but lend the least wary attention. Besides, the words hold forth a plaine distinction continued in the severall members of it. Now the members of a division are opposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. The Apostle intending to lay out the severall officers of the Church in a s≈´mary way (as we have formerly heard) he addresseth himself to a distinct description and discovery of this Officer, as select from the other of Elders, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, 10. Deacons must be grave, and being approved and tryed, let them exercise the Deacons office.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And lastly, Do we look into <hi>Acts</hi> 6.1, 2, 6. we may see the ground and occasion of the institution and scope of their calling, and at what it especially aymes, when there fell a murmuring betwixt the <hi>Graecians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in that their poore were not so comely and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably attended, as they desired and expected: the Apostles perceiving the multitude increasing, and that it would take up their time and pains too much to give full attendance thereunto, as the necessities thereof did require, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed, that they should choose men amongst themselves fitly qualified for that purpose, and they would settle them in that imployment. According to the Apostles counsell, the Church elected, the Apostles prayed, and laid on their hands and appointed them to the performance of that service. Whence it is apparant,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That this was a publick Office, because they were elected in a solemne manner thereunto, and received a solemne insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from the Apostles, and so from Christ, for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that service.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That this their service it was about the attendance of <hi>Tables,</hi> because the provision for the maintenance of the Widows and poore, by a dayly supply as the condition and necessity of the Church did at that time require, gave occasion hereunto; <hi>ergo,</hi> that name is used, and implies the dispensation of the treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, state, and provision of the Church, for those ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses as should appeare usefull, and behovefull for the benefit of the Church, or any member thereof, as far as served for a spirituall end.</p>

These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions being faire and infallible from former grounds it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, What the Episcopall Ordination of a Deacon is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make him half a Priest, or a Priest in preparation, and invest him with power to serve the Priest in the distribution of the Supper, to look to the Poore, to Marry, to Bury, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and Preach, if hee shall be counted worthy to have a licence granted thereunto. But to consecrate the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, that is wholly forbidden him, untill he be made a compleat Priest, which at the next time of Ordination he may attain, if he can provide money to pay for the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Orders. Thus the mystery of iniquity hath eaten into the frame, and wholly defaced the institution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, so that there is nothing of an Evangelicall ordinance, that can be discerned.</p>
                     <p>The first errour (which was indeed the first in let into the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation of the Bishop, and exaltation <hi>of the man of Sin</hi>) was, that they lifted him up above his own pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This Deacon being the steward or Treasurer of the Church, the thing for which he is mainly to be imployed, as for which he was ordained, it is, <hi>for the husbanding of the estate and temporalls of the Church,</hi> as may be every way most behovefull for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the body, according to the rules of the Gospel. And this his service will shew it self in three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He must addresse himself with much observance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those provisions, which shall, or ought to be commited
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111062:165"/> to his trust. I say, due observance in gathering in the state of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is for him to inform himself by advice and counsell from the body, what every mans free-wil-offering should be in making provisions for supplies &amp; paiments of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For though the Church-contribution be a free-will offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in regard it should willingly and wi h a ready heart be tendred unto God: yet neither in the old Testament, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new, the thing it self, nor yet the measure was left to a mans own dispose or libertie. Compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.10. with <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.18, 19. If God hath blessed a man with so many Oxen, he must not offer so many Goats.</p>
                        <p>Vpon this information and direction given by the Body,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He must observe, whether each member performe this his due and dutie: and in case he shall faile he is to admonish him, as swerving from a rule: and in case he reform not, he must follow the action against him, by the rule of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our provided in that behalf, and bring him to the censure of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. What is not offered or given, but promised, he must give attendance with the first to require it, that thus being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant to gather in the stock and provision of the Church, he may not be to seek; nor succour may be wanting, when sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply should be tendered.</p>

               <p>I know also, that it is a <hi>Popish</hi> course, which our <hi>Praelates</hi> use (the reason whereof we shall discover in the proper place thereof) that they <hi>ordain</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi> and when they have layd their hands upon his head, and put his parchments into his

                  <hi>Postquam Praesbyterio consensus Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae innotuit, succedit ad extremum Ordinatio.</hi> And in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, I hope it shall appear, That <hi>Ordination</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>peoples lawfull Election,</hi> as an <hi>Effect</hi> upon the <hi>Cause,</hi> by vertue of which it is fully Administred; So that in the very <hi>Apostolicall</hi> times, the liberty of the very <hi>Apostles</hi> was not so great in <hi>Ordaining</hi> as was the peoples in <hi>Choosing.</hi> For as in <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. its said of that Office of the <hi>Deacons; The people</hi> were first appointed to <hi>choose</hi> and to present the persons to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:</hi> and then they did readily receive the parties, not once questioning what they did; or, by withdrawing their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, refuse to second and establish what they had done. And if the people had this libertie in an <hi>under-Officer,</hi> there was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reason they should have the like in an Officer of <hi>higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> in whom they had greater interest, and by whose Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration they were to receive greater good: so that none were to be Ordained, but such whom they did choose; nor did they, or according to rule could they, refuse to Ordain them so <hi>Elected,</hi> unlesse some just exception was against them, and then also the people were to make a new choice, they were not in that case of errour and aberration from the rule, to take the choyce into their own hands. The proofe of this will appeare in the explication of the other particulars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and therefore we shall proceed therein. <hi>The second thing then to be attended is;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether Ordination gives all the Essentials to an Officer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where there be <hi>two things</hi> come to be scanned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How farre the Essentialls of the Ministery or Minister may be given by man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If they may be given and convayed over by man:</hi> BY WHAT MEANS <hi>men are said to do this, whether by Ordination, or by any other appointment of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these calls for some special disquisition. Because it will appeare upon triall, that the contrivement of these
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111062:168"/> truths is so secret and subtil, that it drives men into divers conceivings, as not being able to discern, how in the work of the institution of the Ministery, the essentialls come to be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven together; the thread is so fine spun, that the dimme eye of mans discerning, can hardly finde it, or follow it, much lesse cut it.</p>
               <p>And because there is here no small difficulty, and it is the <hi>very hinge</hi> upon which many waighty consequences, and in truth, controversies turn; I shall be bold to offer some things to consideration, which at least may cause further inquiry by such, who are better able to fathome these depths. And here as Sea-men use to do, when the Bay or Haven is unknown, or being known, yet hard to hit; I shall as it were sound the Coast by severall <hi>conclusions,</hi> That I may finde where the channell of the truth, in the full strength and streame of it runs.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a Causall vertue put forth in a subordinate way by some under Christ, to bring in the formality or specificall being of an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall office to a person, or party that is called thereunto, or stands possessed thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I say, <hi>[this is done by some]</hi> because it is confessed of all hands that an <hi>externall call</hi> is of necessity required: onely some lay the waight of it in one thing, some in another: but <hi>all agree in this,</hi> whose conceits have but the colour of common sense in them, (the phrensie of some <hi>Familists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> onely excepted, who cashiere all <hi>Governments</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> out of Churches and Common wealths; but this madnesse and folly labours almost with the loathsomnesse of it self) All, I say, that are willing to be led with the light of any reason, doe readily grant there should be an <hi>outward call.</hi> In the lowest order and office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> this was observed by direction Apostolicall, they must not, they could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister, before they were called and appointed thereunto. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5. And it's a staple and standing rule, which teacheth all by proportion. <hi>No man takes this honour to himself, but he that is called as Aaron.</hi> Heb. 5.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>there is a causall vertue put forth in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this power,]</hi> I shall shew, and they will easily confesse, yea when they will expresse themselves freely, their own words evidence as much: unlesse they be forced by the fear of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111062:168"/> the approach of some Argument which might hazard some conceipt, which they are loath to leave and lay aside, then happily they may mince their language, that nothing may be gathered from thence against themselves. I finde that expression in the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul an Apostle not of man nor by man,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>. Men did not institute the office of an Apostle, as the Authors of it: nor was it <hi>by man</hi> as the <hi>instrumentall cause,</hi> convayed over unto <hi>Paul:</hi> but it was <hi>every way immediately from God.</hi> There is therefore in reason (as all Judicious collect out of the place) these Two WAYES of <hi>dispensation</hi> to be attended.</p>
                  <p>First, when <hi>God immediately</hi> institutes and appoints out of his good pleasure any <hi>place</hi> of <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> also from himself appoints the <hi>person</hi> thereunto. Thus the <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> called, <hi>viz. of the Apostles:</hi> were from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Way</hi> of dispensation is <hi>mediate:</hi> when the Institution of the office issues onely from the good pleasure of the Lord, yet he may and doth use other instruments for the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this authority, and the investing of a person with a right to exercise, and yet still the office be truely said to be his alone. And herein the <hi>Popish</hi> usurpation in appointing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp; the orders appointed by them appear to be totally <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi> as the rabble of that wretched crew of <hi>Monks, Fryars, Cardinals, Chancellours,</hi> &amp;c. Because they are <hi>of man</hi> and <hi>by man,</hi> meere humane creatures which the pride and ambition of the heart of the man of sin, the froth and vanity of his minde, hath brought forth into the world, all which prophane beasts he hath provided, as so many rotten pillars, to prop up the the throne of his <hi>Antichristian</hi> power and <hi>Praelacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But those which the <hi>Church,</hi> according to the Institution and allowance of Christ takes up, those are <hi>wholly from him,</hi> as the Author and Institutor of them, yet are they <hi>by the Church,</hi> to whom he hath first delegated power and in a subordinate manner by such instruments, as he sees fit, convayes a right to some persons, that they may possesse such places, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise such offices, according to him without the least impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the royalty and soveraignty of his rule, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in himself alone.</p>
                  <p>To come a little neerer home, that we may lend a little
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111062:169"/> help unto the weakest Reader, that he may lay his finger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the severall things, and see how they lye distinct in the frame of the Institution.</p>
                  <p>First, its a truth, there be no orders nor officers, which have been received or are to be retained in the Churches of Christ, but it is the prerogative royall of the Lord Jesus as King of the Church to appoint them. They are parts of his worship, and there, what he doth not <hi>appoint,</hi> he doth not <hi>approve:</hi> the instituting and using of any other is meerly <hi>will-worship.</hi> And therefore all such persons and performances, as they issue from the folly and froth of mans brains, and <hi>never came into his minde:</hi>

                  <p>Beside, all these places and offices they are appointed for <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>supernaturall ends,</hi> and so to effect <hi>supernaturall works,</hi> even the conversion, sanctification and salvation of such as God hath purposed to bring unto himself. <hi>He</hi> then <hi>alone</hi> must appoint the office, who can <hi>give a blessing</hi> to the <hi>office</hi> and the <hi>officer</hi> to attaine their end: and this none can doe but the Lord Christ alone by the vertue and power of his Regall authority; who now being <hi>ascended, and sitting at the right hand of the Father,</hi> he gave and doth blesse by the presence and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own Spirit. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8, 11. <hi>When Christ ascended up on high, he gave gifts.

He gives these gifts, <hi>that God might dwell amongst the rebellious.</hi> And by them the Churches are <hi>gathered</hi> and <hi>perfected.</hi> Ephes. 4.12, 13. And hence it is by way of <hi>Emulation,</hi> because <hi>Antichrist</hi> saw there was no means to underprop his kingdom, and promote his tyranny, unlesse he had slaves of his own making and creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that would serve his turn, by taking up blinde obedience, in doing his will, though they saw no rule nor reason for it: when therefore <hi>the Pope ascended on high to the chaire of Antichrist,</hi> he also sends his <hi>emissaries</hi> and <hi>instruments</hi> as the swarms of <hi>Locusts out of the bottomlesse pit,</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, but all this while, there is no officer nor office put upon any man, nay though there were never so many, and those fitted and gifted every way, they are <hi>no officers, i. e.</hi> they have not received, nor are invested with a <hi>a right or jus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of Christ, and order of the Gospel,</hi> by such means, which our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> hath ordained, to leave the impression of authority upon them to that purpose, Which, <hi>how</hi> its done, we shall anon inquire: but <hi>that this must</hi> of necessity <hi>be done,</hi> we see it plaine.</p>
                  <p>First, because without <hi>this Call,</hi> none can <hi>warrantably</hi> doe any <hi>act</hi> which belongs to an <hi>officer,</hi> and therefore without this, he hath not the <hi>Specificall form</hi> of an officer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, without this, what ever is done in that behalf, and for that end, is <hi>void</hi> and of <hi>none effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, the <hi>strength, validity,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of an <hi>outward call</hi> herein appears beyond gain-saying, if it proceed from such, who may give it by rule: Because who ever in a regular way hath received this outward call, he is then a <hi>compleat and true officer,</hi> and may act any part of his office, though <hi>not inwardly graced and fitted worthily</hi> to such a place or work <hi>by God.</hi> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> sit <hi>in Moses chair. ie.</hi>

Painted Sepulchres,</hi> grossely hyprcritical and scandalously vile in their generall course, corrupting the <hi>law</hi> by their false and unlearned glosses, and perverting the simple people by their lewd carriages, polluting all Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances by their corrupt handling and administration thereof.</p>
                  <p>And therefore there is more then <hi>Mediatio subjecti</hi> considered in the giving of this <hi>outward call,</hi> if we look at the rigour of the phrase: though (if the Authors will give leave) I would take their meaning to include as much, as what I mention; because I love not to trouble my self and the world with words, or to make any needlesse contention about that, which may admit a fair and rationall construction in any thing. This <hi>mediatas subjecti</hi> then is to be attended, not so much in regard of the parties that are taken to office, but in regard of those, who, in a subordinate way, are <hi>instruments</hi> under Christ, and so as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> put forth a <hi>causall</hi> vertue <hi>to leave the impression of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-right</hi> upon another. For otherwise, we shall not be able to finde and maintaine any mediate calling.</p>
                  <p>Suppose as <hi>Matthias</hi> &amp; <hi>Joseph</hi> were set before the Lord, there should be two persons set apart for the ministery, were there no <hi>causall</hi> vertue coming from those, who were to call, and outwardly to auhorise one to the place, rather then the other; there could be no mediate institution conceived in regard of the parties: they <hi>both equally</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> are <hi>presented</hi> as objects to the call; and <hi>equally</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> (in regard of themselves) lye <hi>open to the call. Joseph</hi> stands not in the way to the call of <hi>Matthias;</hi> nor doth <hi>Matthias</hi> come between <hi>Joseph</hi> and the call.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>herein</hi> lies the <hi>mediatenesse</hi> of the call (that however in regard of themselves, they are equally objected to what call comes) yet <hi>Christ</hi> hath given a <hi>vertuall right</hi> to such as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to apoint, and that he will not dispense immediately a cal from himself to either party: but <hi>they as a meane betweene him and them,</hi> shall leave an <hi>impression</hi> of a <hi>right</hi> of power upon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111062:170"/> one of the parties to exercise such a place.</p>
                  <p>This is also that which they call <hi>[Designatio personae,]</hi> the <hi>designation of a person</hi> to a place. If by that they mean, that they put forth a <hi>casuall</hi> vertue, to <hi>imprint the formality</hi> of the power of office upon such a man; that is the sence I would give, of what they say, and so doe willingly grant what they speake. But if by <hi>Designation</hi> to a place they would <hi>darken the truth with words,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks, and make that the meaning of the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>to wit,</hi> That all the <hi>essentials,</hi> namely, the <hi>materiall and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi> constituting <hi>causes</hi> of <hi>externall office-power</hi> was in the party before, and so he had a compleat specificall being of a call; but <hi>they onely</hi> point him <hi>the place,</hi> and tell him it's fit he should exercise his power here; so that this <hi>designatio personae,</hi> is onely an adjunct to the office he had before without them, but puts forth no causall vertue (as subordinate instruments under Christ) to bring in the <hi>being</hi> of an <hi>outward call.</hi> Then, I say, by <hi>designatio personae,</hi> in this sence, neither the truth is discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor is the thing done that was intended by it.</p>
                  <p>For upon this explication, what <hi>difference</hi> can be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>mediate</hi> call, which we heard out of the <hi>Galathians</hi> to be founded in Scripture, and confessed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle?</hi> For if all the essentials of both inward and outward calling are equally onely from God, then both the callings are equally immediate, since that call is immediate which is conferred without any meanes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I can see no cause to hinder, but that an Officer, which is ordinary, may execute his place <hi>without any call</hi> in the Church; for I would thus dispute, <hi>He that hath all the causes of his call inward and outward without the Church, he hath power and right to exercise his call,</hi> and none hath power and right to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ex concessis, they have all the causes,</hi> if this conceit be true, that <hi>designatio personae</hi> doth adde no <hi>essentials</hi> to the constitution of an outward call (for I suppose there is nothing else out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to be added to make the call:) <hi>Suppose</hi> there were two persons fully, yea, equally gifted and furnished with all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, abilities and willingnesse for the work of the Ministery, which now is wanting to some Congregation, and they both desired that work of Christ: if there was required no more to be done, to bring in all the causes, and so the being of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111062:171"/> power of office, then <hi>both</hi> these <hi>had equall right to officiate;</hi> and though they should officiate any acts <hi>without designation,</hi> they were true acts of an office; whether consecrating or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Sacraments, they were valid: And if they have right to administer, who hath right or authority to hinder?</p>
                  <p>Nor can the words admit any other logicall respect to be put upon them, but <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>effect.</hi> In Acts 14.23. <hi>When they had made or appointed them Elders by way of choice.</hi> The scope of the place is to shew, what provision the Apostle made for the Churches, in supplying them with Officers, and furnishing them with Rulers, which before they had not, but <hi>now,</hi> by Gods appointment, they, under him, <hi>gave a being of an outward call</hi> to such persons, to sustain that place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which formerly they had no power to execute.</p>

                  <p>Hence it followes from the former ground, that <hi>It is an act of power as an Instrument or means,</hi> under Christ, <hi>to give an Officer the being of an outward call in the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I desire the Reader here to recall to mind what formerly hath been expressed and proved, that the minds of the simple may not be troubled, or taken aside from the truth by the ambiguity and mistake of words.</p>
                  <p>When we speak of <hi>power,</hi> the word is of <hi>generall sense</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and hath an influence into every act of judgement, <hi>Yea, judge those that are within,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12. So that there is no <hi>Admonition,</hi> either when one tels another alone, or takes one or two, and convinceth a brother; but there is a processe, in a way <hi>of judiciall proceeding</hi> according to the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ; which is the difference betwixt a <hi>Church-admonition</hi> and a <hi>Christian-admonition.</hi> Between such as are not under such bonds, there is an admonition of <hi>Christian-duty:</hi> Here is an admonition issuing from <hi>Christian-power,</hi> which they have by reason of <hi>the places</hi> in which they are set.

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:111062:171"/>
                  <p>This being conceived and kept in mind, the demonstration of the conclusion is open: <hi>To give power is an act of power;</hi> he or they who give the externall call, or leave the impression of the power of office upon another, they have the <hi>power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that other; they cause that <hi>vertually</hi> which another hath <hi>formally,</hi> not they themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Thirdly, it must be fixed and engraven in the soul in that indelible manner, so that it cannot be blotted out, nor burnt out in the flames of Hell: And in truth, we cannot easily see the sleight and cunning in carving out <hi>this Character;</hi> for the <hi>ayme</hi> of this device was threefold.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the dignity of the Episcopacy might be advanced:</hi> and thence it was, whatever action carries an eminency in any kind, or might cause and cast a reflection of respect upon it, that must be given to <hi>It,</hi> that so men might have an eye <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> and a speciall reference and dependance <hi>thereupon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the honour of Priesthood</hi> (as Papists and Prelats speak) <hi>might be maintaind,</hi> some speciall excellency must be left upon it: And because the basenesse of the carriage of that Popish crew might bring their persons and places out of esteem, therefore they must have some Character that could not be defaced: because their leudnesse and wickednesse was such, that it would deform the very impressions of morality, therefore they devised such a Character that should be engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so deep, that the most abominable prophanenesse of Hell it self should not eat it out to eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because the right of the one, in what he gave, and the worth of the other, in what he received had <hi>no reality;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must <hi>joyne</hi> something, as a farre fetched <hi>conceit,</hi> that the secrecy might hold men in <hi>admiration</hi> of, that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their apprehension, and thence came the minting of this <hi>mysterious nothing.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> True, the Apostle did appoint <hi>him</hi> to do this work, but to doe it <hi>according to his mind;</hi> and in the <hi>order</hi> which <hi>Christ had instituted,</hi> and of which he had given him a <hi>precedent</hi> by his own practice; namely, when the Elders were elected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Church, he then laid on hands upon such, and such onely, according to the order of Christ in that behalf.</p>

                     <p>And that this was the minde of the Apostle, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his charge to <hi>Titus;</hi> the words of the text shew, for its added, <hi>that he should redresse things amisse;</hi> and must not this be done by the Officers, and the Church also, according to the rule of Christ?</p>

                        <p>The word then in the first place signifies, <hi>such graces and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dispositions of heart,</hi> which are <hi>freely given us of God:</hi> and thus it is most common, and frequently used; whether they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces which are bestowed upon such as have no interest in Christ, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7.

                        <p>Of the second sort, we have an instance in the present Text concerning <hi>Timothy,</hi> whose choice to his office was not left to the judgment of men, but was determined by the immediate dictate and direction of the spirit: <hi>quod affirmat</hi> Calvinus: <hi>non humano suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This way of divine revelation, stiled prophesie in the place, was acted in a double manner: <hi>Sometime</hi> the Spirit, by some P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sometime</hi> the Spirit did by speciall revelation dictate to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111062:175"/> Apostles, and prophetically discover who those were, that they should call to such a service, and whom he would enrich and furnish with graces, to so great a work as that was.</p>
                        <p>And this Bish. <hi>Bilson</hi> observed in his Book of the government of the Church:<note place="margin">Cap 7 120. &amp; cap. 9.167.</note> for <hi>if the spirit of God</hi> did immediately direct the Apostles in their <hi>travels</hi> and journyings, and point out their <hi>places</hi> expresly whither they should goe, in reason we cannot but conceive and conclude, the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> would not be wanting to discover to them what <hi>companions</hi> were most fit to further their comfort, and the work especially commended to their care, because there was greater need of direction, and greater good and benefit could not but redound, by the right choice of the one, then the other.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>this last sense I conceive most suitable to the present place,</hi> (leaving each man to his own choice) namely, he enjoyns him to stir up the grace, which by the imposition of his hands <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed by the spirit of Prophesie)</hi> he did according to God his <hi>speciall appointment</hi> communicate unto him; As that was the usuall ceremony taken up for that end and purpose, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. by the Apostle in conveying the graces of the Spirit.</p>

                        <p>This ground being gained, many things follow for our further direction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hence</hi> it is plain, that <hi>Ordination therefore</hi> presupposeth an <hi>Officer constituted,</hi> doth not constitute; <hi>therefore</hi> it's not an act of <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>Order; therefore</hi> those who have <hi>not the power of Office, may put it forth; therefore</hi> though it be most comely,<note place="margin">[Quaere.]</note> that those of <hi>the same</hi> Congregation should exercise it, yet the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> also of <hi>other</hi> Congregations may be invited hereunto, and interested in the exercise of it in another Church, where they have no power, and upon a person who hath more power in the place then themselves: Thus it was here, <hi>Timothy</hi> was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and therefore by vertue of his Office was to move from place to place, to water where the Apostles had planted, as either the need of the people did require, or the Apostles did call, and in those places, <hi>where</hi> the Elders who laid on their hands had certainly nothing to do: they might reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably approve of that power which they could not give nor exercise.</p>

                        <hi>Argument. 3. That</hi> action which is common to persons and performances or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and applied to them, when there is no Office at all given, <hi>that</hi> action cannot properly be said to be a specificating act to make an Officer, or give him a Call.</head>
                     <p>For if it was such an act, that would certainly bring in the form of an Office; where that was, an Officer would be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the action of imposition of hands, is applyed to persons and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as speciall occasion is offered, when there is no Office given, nor indeed intended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>it is not an act which gives in the essentials to an Officer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is evident by instance, Acts 13.2, 3, 4. <hi>As they were ministring,</hi> some <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> the Spirit said, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate unto me Barnabas and Paul, unto the work which I have called
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:111062:177"/> them: and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid on their hands,</hi> they let them go.</p>
                     <p>Where for our purpose in hand, <hi>these particulars</hi> are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our view.</p>
                     <p>First, the Spirit <hi>had formerly</hi> called <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the work, and therefore, the words are in the Preterperfect tense, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Nay, secondly, we read of <hi>Paul</hi> his Call and Commission given him expresse, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.16, 17. And lastly, the Office being <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> from God, it could not be, that the Officers or Elders of the Church could be the cause of the call, for that implyes a contradiction, to be <hi>mediately</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> called.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Church by her Officers were therefore appointed to separate them to that service, unto which they had been before called of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this separation is signified &amp; performed by prayer, and laying on of the hands of the Officers; which was <hi>not</hi> to put a <hi>new Office</hi> upon them, but <hi>confirme</hi> their sending unto the Gentiles, <hi>Chamierus</hi> lib. 4. de Sacram. N. T. cap. 24. p. 25. <hi>Non putamus hanc impositionem manuum, ullam fuisse ordinationem ad novum munus Ecclesiasticum, sed confirmationem missionis, &amp;c.</hi> whence it's plain, That imposition is an act which is common to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and applied upon other occasions; <hi>therefore is not a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficating act to bring in this call of an Officer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And upon this ground it seems it is, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is so far from conceiving laying on of hands necessary in Ordinations, that they do not onely not use it, but judge it unlawfull to be used, unlesse some speciall considerations be attended; as it may appear in that accurate work called, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>But this</hi> Individuum vagum, <hi>or a Pastor at large is irregular and crosse to the order of the Gospel:</hi> For,</p>
                     <p>First, in this (as Master <hi>Best</hi> saith) an Apostle differeth from a Pastor, that the Apostle is a Pastor through the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world; but the Pastor is tyed to a certain Congregation out of which he is not to exercise Pastorall acts.</p>
                     <p>To this Master <hi>R.</hi> answers, <q>We allow of no Pastors ordained without a certain flock.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I reply, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum videam facta?</hi> what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in word is one thing; if their opinion of necessity infer what they seem not to allow, is another: their grant hath a constraining power to conclude what Master <hi>Best</hi> alleageth. For if a Pastor may have all his essentials without a certain flock, then he may be a Pastor without it, there being no more required to the essence of his Office. And I strange how Master <hi>R.</hi> remembred not what he wrote two pages before 263. <q>That <hi>A. B.</hi> is made indefinitely a Pastor for a Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Suppose a people should reject a Pastor, and that upon just grounds, <hi>(he confesseth not many lines before)</hi> that they cannot make him no Pastor, yet they can make him be without a certain flock.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which is added doth not loosen the knot, but tyes it faster; for where it's said, <q>An Apostle was Pastor to all the world, yet might he exercise Pastorall acts of Preaching and Praying towards those people, who would not receive his Ministery.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> The same may be said of this <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> upon the former ground and grant, he may exercise his Pastoral act even to Heathens, who reject him and his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>That which is lastly answered yeelds the cause wholly, for these are the words, p. 266. <q>And a Pastor is ONELY the Pastor of that flock over the which the holy Ghost, by the Churches authority, hath set him as their Pastor; but yet so as when he preacheth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregation, he ceaseth not to be a Pastor, howbeit not the Pastor of that flock.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE ARE THEN AGREED, and the conclusion is granted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If a Pastor be</hi> [ONELY] <hi>onely the Pastor to that flock, then is he not a Pastor to any beside, then can he do no Pastorall acts to them:</hi> To whom he is not Pastor, to them he can do no Pastorall acts; <hi>but in that place and to that people he is not a Pastor,</hi> therefore to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111062:178"/> them he can doe Pastorall acts, <hi>Quod fuit demonstrandum?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>True,</hi> while he preacheth to another Congregation, <hi>he ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be a Pastor:</hi> it's that, we all say and grant, but yet he doth not preach as a Pastor: He expounds in his <hi>own family,</hi> and prayes as a <hi>Master of his family,</hi> but <hi>not as a Pastor,</hi> and yet he <hi>ceaseth not to be a Pastor</hi> whilest he doth that work: He <hi>is such</hi> while he doth it, but <hi>doth</hi> it <hi>not as such.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's obvious to each mans apprehension; a thing may have many relations, and may act by vertue of one onely; though it have the other, yet nor doth, nor can act by those other in that place.</p>

                        <p>No man is said to take the communion of Cities away, when he denies the <hi>Major</hi> of one to exercise authority in <hi>the jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or corporation of the other; for that was to take away their priviledges and proprieties, not communities, as it will appear presently from Master <hi>R.</hi> his own principles.</p>

                        <p>

                           <hi>Again,</hi> a Pastor of one Congregation may preach unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a Pastor of <hi>one Classis</hi> or <hi>Province</hi> may <hi>preach</hi> in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>another Classis,</hi> and in <hi>another Province;</hi> yet in none of these he can doe any <hi>Pastorall act,</hi> as I shall prove from Master <hi>R.</hi> his grant.</p>

                           <hi>But over these a Pastor hath no power;</hi> so Master Ruterford: <hi>"We hold, that one Congregation hath no power over another, nor one Classis over another, nor one Province over another.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let this be considered, <hi>If acts of Pastorall</hi> preaching, administration of Sacraments, and Church-censures, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, rebuking, &amp;c. be required by <hi>Church communion,</hi> then there be <hi>no acts</hi> which a Congregation hath <hi>proper</hi> to it self; and this was not onely to maintain <hi>communion,</hi> but indeed to breed <hi>confusion</hi> in all the Churches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly, where</hi> a man hath <hi>right</hi> to administer <hi>Pastorall acts, there</hi> he hath Pastorall <hi>power;</hi> where he hath right of Pastorall power, there he may <hi>by right challenge the execution</hi> of this Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power: <hi>therefore</hi> the <hi>Pastors of severall Congregations</hi> without the Classis, may notwithstanding, crave liberty to <hi>presse into the Classis</hi> assembled, to joyn their vote and censure, and sentence with the Classis, either to hasten or hinder any act; which were to whorry all things on heaps, and disturb the order of all Assemblies.</p>
                        <p>And hence it was that the ancient Councels and Canons have ever added so much caution to curb and <hi>confine</hi> the power of <hi>Bishops,</hi> that they should not stretch the armes of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority beyond the compasse of their own Diocesse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That</hi> they made then a <hi>Diocaesan,</hi> it was a <hi>humane device;</hi> but <hi>yet</hi> they found it necessary to <hi>restrain</hi> the extravagancy of such; which did it belong to them <hi>as Pastors indefinitely</hi> to oversee <hi>all,</hi> they should not onely have <hi>wronged</hi> them, but the <hi>rule,</hi> who so much enlarged their rule and jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>And that which learned <hi>Junius</hi> speaks of the largenesse and lawfulesse of the extent of the Bishops rule by humane grant, that to goe beyond his bounds is to be <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>That which is alleaged touching the <hi>partaking of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by some of one Congregation in another,</hi> hath of all the greatest difficulty, because the administration of the Sacrament is a <hi>Ministeriall act,</hi> and can be done but <hi>by a Pastor</hi> or <hi>Teacher;</hi> and what <hi>authority</hi> hath he to do it, or <hi>they</hi> to receive it from him, to whom he is <hi>non Pastor?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:111062:179"/>
                        <p>To which I shall <hi>Reply</hi> thus; first, that it hath beene a course which ever I have questioned; and against it many yeeres since I have alledged many arguments, and therefore I could readily ease my selfe of the Argument, by professing the course unwarrantable. And that the course of the Churches in <hi>England</hi> in their corrupt way, hath given in some such like intimation; forbidding any to receive at another place, but onely where they properly have their abode, and constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Ministery of the place.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>supposing</hi> it to be <hi>lawfull,</hi> we will see how farre the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will goe, at the least how farre it toucheth the cause in hand.</p>
                        <p>First then, these particulars are plaine and beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<list>
                              <item>1. The Minister hath power to consecrate the elements in <hi>his owne place</hi> and charge.</item>
                              <item>2. In that he <hi>there</hi> consecrates and administers, HE doth not goe beyond HIS Pastorall power.</item>
                              <item>3. <hi>Nor</hi> can he <hi>reject, whom the Assembly lawfully admits.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, therefore now the question growes; <hi>What title any of another Congregation have to come to the Sacrament, and by what right the Church can admit them?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the clearing of which proceeding, I shall offer these things to consideration, having an open eare to heare and learne.</p>
                        <p>First, a person hath his <hi>first right</hi> to a Sacrament, because he hath an interest in the <hi>covenant of the Gospell,</hi> of which it is a seale; but must come at it <hi>in a right order</hi> of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> the party must be <hi>member of a visible Congregation;</hi> because the seales can there onely be rightly and orderly administred. I say <hi>its sufficient</hi> the party be a member <hi>of a visible</hi> Congregation, not <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Hence, who ever is thus qualified, may <hi>lawfully</hi> be <hi>admitted</hi> to that ordinance <hi>by the Assembly;</hi> therefore cannot <hi>lawfully</hi> be <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Pastor: quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that <hi>such</hi> an <hi>administration</hi> doth not evidence that the Ruler doth any thing <hi>beyond</hi> his place, or hath any power <hi>out</hi> of HI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap> place or particular charge, or yet that the <hi>receiver</hi> shares in any thing more then <hi>His</hi> right.</p>

                        <p>The fourth and last Argument of M. <hi>Ruterf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>That opinion must be reasonlesse and without ground, the speciall reason and ground whereof is false: but the speciall ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this opinion is false; <hi>therefore.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The assumption is proved, because we are said to maintaine, That election and ordination of Pastors is all one; and that Pastors have essentially their calling from the election of the people.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Reply is.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>assumption</hi> and the proofe of it, I never saw it writ, nor ever knew it practised by any amongst our selves. The utmost that ever I knew was ever acknowledged or avowed, is that of Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> namely, that <hi>Ordination</hi> it is <hi>adjunctum consummans;</hi> the <hi>compleating of the essence of a Pastor,</hi> by an especiall perfecting adjunct; but enters <hi>not</hi> into the <hi>essentiall constitution:</hi> but that <hi>it</hi> and <hi>election</hi> should be <hi>all one,</hi> I never yet knew it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                        <p>We see therefore the <hi>proofe,</hi> that should be the maine pillar to beare up the stresse of the argument, breakes all in peeces, and is a <hi>meere</hi> mistake; so that the force of the argument melts away like snow before the Sun.</p>
                        <p>That which remaines as <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>proofe</hi> of the <hi>assumption,</hi> That we say, <hi>Pastors have essentially their calling from election,</hi> wee shall in the following discourse make good, Christ helping.</p>
                        <p>OUR FIFTH AND LAST Argument is:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If Ordination gives the essentials of a Pastor before election, then by</hi> THAT ALONE <hi>he hath Pastorall power:</hi> Against which I thus reason:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He that hath compleat power of an Office, and stands an Officer without exception, he cannot justly be hindered from doing all acts of that Office.</hi> For to be an Officer compleat, without an Office; or being compleat in his Office, yet according to rule, to be hindered from doing any thing belonging to his Office, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction: for its all one as to say, a man is bound to a rule, and yet by a rule he should not doe it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this is the condition of a Pastor, ordained, without the election of the people:</hi> He may according to rule be justly hindered from executing any act of a Pastor. Suppose all Congregations f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>ll; they may justly deny him any leave or liberty to Preach
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111062:180"/> or administer, either seale or censure amongst them. And so he shall be an Officer compleat and without exception, and yet shall be justly and according to rule hindered from doing any act of his Office; which is crosse to reason, and the rule of an Office-bearing.</p>
                        <p>By this time we have passed all the sholes and sands, which crossed us in our course, and have finished the NEGATIVE part of our Discourse, <hi>viz. what it is that doth not give the essentials of the call of a Pastor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are now come within the sight of the point, if through mercy we shall be able to weather it safely, we shall satisfie our selves.</p>
                        <p>For the AFFIRMATIVE PART, our Conclusion then is this:
<q>Election of the People rightly ordered by the rule of Christ, gives the essentials to an Officer, or leaves the impression of a true outward call, and so an Office-power upon a Pastor.</q>
                        </p>

                     <p>Its taken from that <hi>relation,</hi> which God according to the rule of reason hath placed betwixt the <hi>Pastor</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> whence the dispute growes.</p>

                     <p>For <hi>his grounds</hi> are these:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Election doth not make a Pastor, because Ordination doth; <hi>which he barely affirmes, and he knowes is constantly denied, and hath in our foregoing dispute beene disproved. He addes,</hi> Election doth not make a Minister, but onely appropriate him, being formerly made to the Church. <hi>Again, A.B.</hi> is indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Pastor to a Church.</q>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:111062:181"/>
                     <p>These are bare assertions, which may be with as much right and ease denied as affirmed, and have been proved in our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going conclusions to be disagreeing to the truth. Laying aside then all prejudice, let us look over the severall propositions of the Argument, and see where the doubt can arise.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is supported by the <hi>fundamentall</hi> principles of <hi>reason,</hi> so that he must rase out the received <hi>rules of Logick</hi> that must reject it: <hi>Relata sunt, quorum unum constat e mutu√¢ alterius affectione:</hi> and hence all men that will not stifle and stop the passage of rationall discourse, forthwith infer, that therefore they are <hi>simul natur√¢,</hi> are together in nature one with another: a <hi>father,</hi> as a relate or father, is <hi>not before his son,</hi> buying before selling, selling before buing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Assumption.</hi> That <hi>Pastor</hi> and People, Shepherd and <hi>Flock</hi> are relates, no man that hath sipped on Logick, hath a forehead to gainsay.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>premises</hi> being so sure and plain, the <hi>conclusion</hi> must be certain and undeniable.</p>
                     <p>And hence also it will follow, that they are <hi>simul natur√¢,</hi> and the one cannot be before the other; <hi>there cannot be a Pastor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a People, which choose him.

                     <p>And hence again it followes, that <hi>Ordination,</hi> which comes after, is <hi>not</hi> for the <hi>constitution</hi> of the Officer, but the <hi>approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of him so constituted in his Office.

                     <p>The <hi>consequence</hi> is plain from the staple rule, <hi>Ejusdem est insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere, destituere.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Master <hi>R.</hi> answers, p. 265. <q>Its true, the People have power to

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> If this be true, then a species may be destroyed, and the generall nature in it preserved; the particular and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall nature of <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>John</hi> may perish and be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet that generall nature of <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>John</hi> shall still be safe and maintained, which is, I confesse, beyond my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, this rejection cuts him off from being a member in that Congregation where he was, and so from every visible Congregation, therefore cuts him off from having any visible Church-communion with Christ, as a Politicall head of the visible Church, therefore from being any ministeriall member, and so an Eye, or Hand, or Officer in that Body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence,</hi> the <hi>superiour</hi> may delegate to the <hi>inferior.</hi>

                        <hi>Hence,</hi> he may give <hi>some</hi> part of his power to another, and <hi>keepe</hi> to himselfe the <hi>chiefest.</hi> As he that is Lord of divers Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Townes, may give away both Land and Lordship, over the places and persons to others, and reserve some roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty (as they call it) to himselfe. So <hi>a King</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or some supreame power, in whom such authority is seated, may make <hi>under-officers,</hi> as <hi>Sheriffes, Baylifes, Constables, &amp;c. Nay,</hi> may leave his power wholly, and give it up and his place also unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in ordinary course is usually seene and observed. But to <hi>give</hi> his power <hi>wholly</hi> to another, and <hi>yet</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> his place and authority he cannot; and therefore to make another <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equall</hi> with him, in the full power he had, and now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, that he <hi>cannot do.</hi> A Prince may divide his Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rule into two portions, and make others share with him therein, and that equally (namely, equall to what <hi>now</hi> he hath, not what he <hi>had.</hi>) And hence it comes to passe, when <hi>ordination</hi> was conceived to be <hi>authoritative delegation</hi> (I speake onely of a <hi>Ministeriall</hi> manner of dispensation) and put into the hand of the <hi>Bishop;</hi> He presently begins to challenge place of <hi>superiority</hi> over those to whom he delegates. That the <hi>whole</hi> care and cure of the <hi>Diocesse</hi> belongs to him, and he commits <hi>severall portions</hi> to severall men, that they might <hi>share</hi> in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem solicitudinis,</hi> when HE had <hi>plenitudinem potestatis,</hi> as they use to speake.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>hence</hi> came that wofull generation of <hi>Curates</hi> and <hi>∆≤icars.</hi> And that <hi>device of ordination sine titulo,</hi> when the <hi>Bishop</hi> left <hi>some</hi> impression <hi>of his power</hi> (as it were in <hi>deposito</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till there came a fit time to dispense it.</p>
                     <p>Hence came the <hi>mangling</hi> of <hi>Offices</hi> into broken parts. There must be one <hi>ordination</hi> to make him <hi>Deacon,</hi> another to make him <hi>Priest:</hi> and when all is done, the poore <hi>Devotiatory</hi> must have yet a further <hi>License</hi> to Preach. By all which, not onely the Fees of the Court and the Bishops Officers came to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished; (but which is, and was the <hi>main</hi>) that it <hi>might hence appeare, that the power was seated in him,</hi> and he carves out such peeces and portions therof to his underlings, as suits best with his pleasure.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:111062:182"/>
                     <p>Some of these pangs of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> like the <hi>moths</hi> of the Mystery of iniquity, have eaten into the <hi>Presbytery</hi> in some measure. <hi>They have taken power to themselves to ordaine before ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to make indefinite Pastors;</hi> which argues they must have power seated in themselves; <hi>all the causes</hi> of this Office-power <hi>arising</hi> from themselves: <hi>they clip the wings, nay in truth cut off the hands of the Congregation in the worke of censure:</hi> For they have taken this liberty from them. For that Church that may speake to the offender, that Church in case he heare not, may excommunicate the offender. But they say, the Classis onely can doe that.</p>
                     <p>From the former ground it also followes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he who is of the lowest administration, or whose Ministeriall power is the lowest in his kinde, <hi>he cannot delegate to another:</hi> for then, to a lower.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he who is bound to officiate or execute his owne place in his owne person, he cannot delegate it, or any part thereof to another.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where a person never had power to rule, he cannot there give power to rule.</p>
                     <p>From which <hi>grounds</hi> I would <hi>reason:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If a Person, and so a Presbyter, have Ministeriall power, and that in the lowest kinde of it, and are bound to execute their owne places, in their owne persons alone; Then can they not delegate their power or any part thereof to another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the first is true;</hi> therefore,</p>
                     <p>I would here demand, <hi>what that power is,</hi> which is conceived they doe <hi>delegate</hi> from themselves <hi>alone?</hi> I say <hi>[alone] (ut supra)</hi> because all the causes of the power issue out of themselves alone.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be a <hi>supernaturall saving quality,</hi> because it is given to such who have no saving grace.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be a <hi>common</hi> grace, because then there would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be found some reall change, by the conveyance of such <hi>habits,</hi> and that upon such a sudden, as the laying on of hands, which we see there is none; and then the losse or <hi>defacing</hi> of such common qualities would take away the <hi>essentials</hi> of the call, and nullifie the essence of an Officer; which we see it nor doth, nor can, as it appears in the <hi>Pharisees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What then is communicated?</hi> (we here see what use we have of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111062:183"/> the consideration of Character, <hi>indelibilis</hi> before;) to speak home at a push, <hi>if any be communicated, it must be a relation;</hi> so <hi>Durand</hi> confesseth, speaking of the character, which is left (as they dream) by the Sacrament of <hi>Order,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sentent. <hi>40.</hi> qu</note> when he could finde no footstep of any reality, <hi>where</hi> to set it, and <hi>what</hi> to make of it, <hi>he ingeniously professeth it is a Relation,</hi> because that answers all the ends of this intention. And herein he sayes true, but withall overthrowes what they intend by what he sayes; for <hi>if it</hi> be a <hi>relation: where are the</hi> termini <hi>or foundation betwixt whom this relation stands?</hi> here we are utterly at a losse, and that the rest of the Popish crew easily perceived, and therefore would not give way to this, because they cleerly perceived, that the <hi>Pastor</hi> was in <hi>relation to his people;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the <hi>essence</hi> of this <hi>indelibilis</hi> character, and so this power also must <hi>arise from his people,</hi> which would quite spoil the fashion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the <hi>soveraignty</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> ordination.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>there is a communicating of power by</hi> VOLUNTARY SUBJECTION when, though there be <hi>no Office-power, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> in the people, yet they willingly yeelding themselves to be ruled by another, desiring and calling of him to take that rule; he accepting of what they yeeld, possessing that right which they put upon him by free consent; <hi>hence ariseth this Relation and authority of Office-rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason;
<q>Those in whose choice it is whether any shall rule over them or no; from their voluntary subjection it is, that the party chosen hath right, and stands possessed of rule and authority over them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence many things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, there is an <hi>act of power put forth in election.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which causally gives essence and Office-power, that puts forth an act of power, <hi>Ergo.</hi> And therefore the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes (which would darken the declaration of this truth used by Master <hi>R.</hi> p. 265.) do not hold. <q>Now Ordination <hi>(sayes he)</hi> is an act of jurisdiction, such as to send an Embassadour: but that an Embassadour consent to goe (such as is election) is no act of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For a Father to give his Daughter im marriage to one, is an authoritative act of a Father; but for the Daughter to consent to the choice is no act of authority.</q>

                        <hi>Election</hi> in the <hi>concrete</hi> (as we call it) implyes two things;

                           <item>1. The <hi>choice</hi> on the peoples part:</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>True, <hi>consenting</hi> argues no power; but <hi>their giving of him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> over them, their calling and by willing <hi>subjection,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up themselves to be ruled by him in Christ, is <hi>an act of Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vocationis essentia est in electione ecclesiae, &amp; acceptatione electi,</hi> Ames medul. lib. 1. c. 39. sect. 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence</hi> the <hi>power</hi> that the <hi>Pastor</hi> hath, extends no <hi>larger</hi> nor further then <hi>his own</hi> people; he hath no more then what they give, no more but this: for their subjection is onely from themselves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence</hi> such may, by a <hi>vertuall power,</hi> bring in the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>ruling power,</hi> who neither have the power formally nor can exercise the act of that power and place lawfully.</p>
                     <p>The Church or people can <hi>make a Pastor</hi> (as we say) by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who <hi>cannot do a Pastorall act,</hi> as administer a Sacrament, &amp;c. which is in this place especially to be observed, because the collection is full and fair from the conclusion proved, and the weaknesse, feeblenesse and falsnesse of the contrary colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Master <hi>Ball,</hi> and Master <hi>R.</hi> in severall places take up, is here evidently discovered and answered, when they thus collect, <q>If the people could vertually give being to Pastor and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then they might execute the Office of Pastors and Teachers:</q> the contrary whereunto hath been evicted by the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and daily and ordinary experience yeelds the like.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Hence persons may <hi>vertually communicate</hi> power to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who <hi>are inferiour to,</hi> and ought to be ruled by that power so communicated, because they gave both place and power to the Officers by <hi>voluntary subjection,</hi> investing them with rule and right to govern, and promised reverence, submission and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the rule and authority in their hands: so that when they walk according to the lawes of that place and authority they have, they are to submit to them in the Lord: but when
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111062:184"/> they go beyond their place and power, they may by the rules of the Gospel reform them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Hence</hi> lastly, we see the feeblenesse of that conceit, which is moldy with the tang of the mystery of iniquity, by which it was conceived first, and hath been maintained; <hi>to wit,</hi> that <hi>episcopus generat patres,</hi> and this made a piece of the royalty and peculiar priviledge belonging to his place.</p>

                        <hi>If the essentials of a Pastor be communicated from the Eldership or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop meerly; then there will be Pastor of Pastors, and that in propriety of speech.</hi>

                     <p>For the Pastor that is made by them hath reference to them, and dependance upon them as Pastors properly; for it is <hi>that</hi> which is contended for here in the question in hand, that it should be <hi>appropriated to their places onely to make Officers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But this Master</hi> R. <hi>condemnes, and reason gainsayes:</hi> for it would breed and bring a confusion amongst all Offices and Officers, and it is charged upon us and our cause, as an absurdity, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Master <hi>R.</hi> we desire they would take the charge home to themselves, to whom it justly belongs, as being firstly guilty of it: and so at length we have done with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We are now come to the third thing to be considered.</hi>

                        <head>
                           <hi>3.</hi> What Ordination is.</head>
                        <p>The premises formerly considered and drunke in, we shall onely nakedly propound the description, not trouble the Reader with any tedious dispute about it; because the most and chiefe of the difficulties, which concerne the nature of it, have been discussed fully before.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>ORDINATION is an</hi> approbation of the Officer, and solemn setling and confirmation of him in his Office, by Prayer and laying on of hands.</q>
                        <p>The <hi>severals of the description</hi> have been cleared, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going conclusions; onely that which is added, <hi>touching the ceremony of laying on of hands:</hi> though there be no convicting arguments in the Scripture, which will infallibly conclude it;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111062:184"/> yet, because it is most commonly received, and seemes most probable out of that charge to <hi>Timothy; Lay on hands rashly on no man, neither communicate with other mens sins.</hi> I am willing to follow the rode, when I have no constraining reason to goe aside.</p>
                        <p>Onely I shall adde in this place. That from the description now propounded, the explication and confirmation which hath been given before, it seemes to be a <hi>faire inference,</hi> that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is not an act of supreame Jurisdiction, but of order rather. It gives not being or constitution to an Officer, but is rather the admission and confirmation of him in his Office.</hi>
                        </p>

Nam ubicunque est Ecclesia, ibi est jus administrandi Evangelii. Quare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est Ecclesiam retinere jus vocandi, eligendi, &amp; ordinandi Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stros: &amp; hoc jus est donum datum Ecclesiae, quod nulla humana autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas Ecclesiae eripere potest, sicut Paulus testatur ad Ephes: cum ait, Ascendit, dedit dona hominibus, &amp; enumerat inter dona propria, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Pastores &amp; Doctores, &amp; addit, dari tales ad ministerium, ad aedificationem corporis Christi; ubi igitur est vera Ecclesia, ubi esse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est jus eligendi, &amp; ordinandi Ministros. De potestate Episcoporum argumento secundo.</hi> What can be more plain, unlesse it was writ with the beam of the Sun? and as his judgement is full and cleer, so his Argument is strong.</p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:111062:185"/>
                        <p>All these <hi>Officers</hi> are <hi>coronation-mercies</hi> given to the Church; the <hi>extraordinary</hi> are given <hi>immediately;</hi> the <hi>ordinary, mediately;</hi> namely, that she should have power not only to <hi>preserve</hi> them when she hath them, but to <hi>provide them</hi> when she wants them: and unlesse she could do the one, she should never do the other. For were it so, that ordinary Pastors should be made, and then given to her, how were they not as immediate as the other? Most expresse to the same purpose is <hi>Whitaker,</hi> contr. 4. q. 2. c. 15. p. 2. <hi>Ecclesiae potestas data est suos episcopos &amp; pastores nominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di &amp; curandi: &amp; quanquam tota non potest fungi hoc munere, potest ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eligere &amp; ordinare, qui eo fungantur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in case then that the face and form of all the Churches are generally corrupted, or else the condition of the Church is such, that she is <hi>wholly destitute of Presbyters,</hi> she may then out of her <hi>own power,</hi> given her by Christ, provide for her own comfort, <hi>by ordaining her own Ministers;</hi> and this according to the regular appointment of our Saviour, and the order of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Christ hath firstly the whole power of Ordination in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Church as his Spouse hath it communicated to her; and <hi>this power she exerciseth after a double manner;</hi> either she <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, elects</hi> and <hi>ordains a Presbytery,</hi> by which she may ordain in future times; or having constituted and ordained such, she <hi>preserves and maintains them,</hi> that she may use them as <hi>instruments</hi> to ordain: the first of these ways she useth in <hi>raising and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches after great apostacies</hi> and universall departures from the sincerity of the truth: The second, in time of peace when <hi>all the Ordinances of Christ are in their pure and constant use,</hi> and Officers continued by an un-interrupted succession, in the profession and maintainance of the truth.</p>
                        <p>And touching this third all the difficulty lyes and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is betwixt us; we shall shortly therefore settle this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion by some few arguments which follow from the former dispute, and confirm this with undeniable evidence.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>If the power of ordaining rest firstly in the Church, then she may, and in this case having most need, should provide for her own sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: but the power of Ordination is given first unto the Church,</hi> as hath been forced by <hi>Melanchton</hi> from ungainsayable grounds, <hi>ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>If the Church can do the greater, then she may do the lesse;</hi> the acts, appertaining to the same thing, and being of the same kind.</p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:111062:186"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the Church can doe the greater,</hi> namely, <hi>give the essentials</hi> to the Pastor, <hi>ut supra,</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which is not an act of Power but Order, the Church may do in an orderly way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the reason why it's conceived and concluded, that it's beyond the power of the people, it is because it is an act of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this is an act of Order and not of Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, Most certain it is, that this cannot belong primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Classis.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>But the first is true, even from the constitution of a Classis, <hi>Ergo.</hi> And it is as certain, that it <hi>cannot firstly belong to a Bishop,</hi> which by humane invention and consent is preferred before a Presbyter in dignity onely, if they will hold themselves either to the precedent or patent, whence they raise their pedegree: And it is from that of <hi>Hierom ad evagrium, unum e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. III. Of an INDEPENDENT Church.</hi> Wherein the state of the Question is opened, the distastefull terme of <hi>INDEPENDENCY</hi> cleered, and the right meaning put upon it; Master <hi>R.</hi> his Arguments in the thirteenth Chapter debated.</head>
               <p>IT is the <hi>subtilty of Satan,</hi> when he cannot wholly destroy the truth, which he especially desires, he labours to deface it what he may, and to present it in such unseemly appearances unto men, that either they reject it wholly; or if not <hi>that,</hi> yet
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111062:186"/> they are long before they receive it; or if they do, it being under jealousies and suspitions, they receive it but in part, and not with that full approbation as they might, and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</p>
               <p>And hence through the <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>distaste</hi> of some, the <hi>headi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>rashnesse</hi> of others, men put such unsuitable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon it, like an ill-shaped garment upon a wel-composed body, that it shewes somewhat deformed at the first sight.</p>
               <p>This hath befaln the cause now in hand, by the term of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi> put upon it‚ñ™ which because in common use it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a ranknesse of Supremacy, which easily disrelisheth with the spirits of men, being used here somewhat improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the first appearance it easily provokes a nauseous distaste in the spirit of the hearer, that is not acquainted so fully with the compasse of the cause now under hand.</p>
               <p>We shall take leave therefore to lay open <hi>the state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> nakedly as it is, and narrow the expressions a little, where because of their unfitnesse and widenesse, they leave a kind of ill favoured appearance upon the truth.</p>
               <q>The state of the Question then may thus be conceived:</q>
               <p>When we speak of the <hi>Church,</hi> as in this place, we look at it not as <hi>totum essentiale</hi> onely, as they use to speak, <hi>as</hi> it is <hi>made up</hi> and constituted of <hi>visible Christians,</hi> gathered in the fellowship of the faith; but as <hi>totum Integrale,</hi> or <hi>Organicum</hi> (as <hi>Ames</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, lib. 1. <hi>medul.</hi> cap. 33. part 18.) <hi>as it is furnished</hi> and <hi>compleated with all such Officers,</hi> which Christ hath given to his Church for the perfecting thereof: for <hi>then and not before,</hi> the Church is said to be <hi>able</hi> in a right order to act and exercise all the ordinances of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When this Church is said to be <hi>Independent,</hi> we must know That INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>DENCY implies two things;
<list>
                     <item>1. Either an <hi>absolute Supremacy,</hi> and then it is opposed to <hi>subordination.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Or else a <hi>sufficency</hi> in its kind, for the attainment of its end, and so its opposed to <hi>imperfection.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Take <hi>that</hi> word in the <hi>first sence, so a particular Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is not absolutely supreame:</hi> For its subject unto, and under the supreme power politicke in the place where it is; so that the <hi>Magistrate hath a coactive power</hi> to compel the Church
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111062:187"/> to execute the ordinances of Christ, according to the order and rules of Christ, given to her in that behalfe in his holy Word; and in case she swerves from her rule, by a strong hand to constraine her to keepe it. Hee is a nursing Father thus to the Church, to make her attend that wholesome dyet which is provided and set out, as her share and portion in the Scripture. Nay, should the supream Magistrate unjustly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or persecute, she must be subject, and meekly according to justice, beare that which is unjustly inflicted.</p>
               <p>Againe, she is so farre <hi>subject to the consociation of Churches,</hi> that she is bound, in case of doubt and difficulty, to crave their counsell, and if it be according to God, to follow it: and if she shall erre from the rule, and continue obstinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>they have authority to renounce the right hand of fellowship</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>second sence,</hi> the Church may be said to be <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> namely, <hi>sufficient to attaine her end;</hi> and therefore hath <hi>compleat power,</hi> being rightly constituted, to exercise all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God.</p>
               <p>As <hi>all Arts</hi> are thus <hi>compleat</hi> in their <hi>kinde,</hi> and have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fufficiency in themselves to attaine their owne end; and <hi>yet</hi> are truely said to be <hi>subordinate</hi> each to the other in their workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Word, then, in its faire and inoffensive sence, imports <hi>thus much, Every particular Congregation, rightly constituted and compleated, hath sufficiency in it selfe, to exercise all the ordinances of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus there is no harshnesse in the Word that offends the Hearer; nor is the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>se hard or difficult, which may load the cause with any loathsome distaste at all, was the minde not prepossest with prejudice.</p>
               <p>For its granted of all, that it hath <hi>this sufficiency</hi> in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>some</hi> ordinances; as to Preach, dispense Sacraments, without either craving or needing the consent of the Classis; nor was she to yeeld to the judgement of the Classis, if they should forbid her to execute her worke.</p>
               <p>And if she have a compleatnesse of power in the highest Ordinances, why she should be denied the like in those that are of lesse excellency, I know not: or why the one should be conceived so strange, and the other so ordinary and equall,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111062:187"/> I see not; the Apostle knew no dispensation of so choice an excellency <hi>as Preaching,</hi> which he prefers before any other; <hi>I was sent to preach the Gospel, not to baptize:</hi> q. d. that was the chiefest part of his errand. If <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Excommunication</hi> had been of so great eminency above all other, certainly he would have mentioned some of them.</p>
               <p>It was the old kind of reasoning, which went currant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any gainsaying: <hi>praedicare potest, corpus Domini conficere potest,</hi> ergo, <hi>potest etiam consecrare:</hi> Plesseus apud Gers. Bucer, dissert. de gubern. eccles.</p>
               <p>It's granted also by Master <hi>R.</hi> that in Islands which are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the main land, and therfore cannot enjoy the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of neighbouring Churches, with that comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, as their occasions may require, that among them <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> and so <hi>excommunication</hi> may be performed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>This being an ordinary and common case, which fals out in the usuall and constant course of providence, and many such, which carry a proportion hereunto; I say, hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the power natively and naturally lyes in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>For to think that <hi>these occasions</hi> should put God to such <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary dispensations, as to crosse his ordinary rule;</hi> or that the exercise of the act of Ordination should again return into his own hand, to be immediately dispensed by himself, is too weak. As the Jesuits in the like manner are put to their shifts, when they cannot tell what is become of the power supream that was in the <hi>Pope,</hi> when he dyes; because there must not be two Popes on earth; they are therefore forced to say, that it is <hi>re-assumed into the hands of Christ;</hi> the feeblenesse of which conceit is confuted and condemned by all our Writers, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak. Junius, Ames.</hi> The like may be here said: and to put the Lord Christ to immediate and extraordinary wayes, when according to the course of ordinary traffique and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as the States civill, in such places have intercourse with other States, so might the Churches have with other Churches: It hath no shew of Scripture or reason; especially if we adde, That the first Synod, which is made a pattern to all the rest, was a concurrence of such Churches, which were two hundred miles off one from another.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:111062:188"/>
               <p>Lastly, it shall anon appear, that he maintains such a <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> of acting all Gods Ordinances amongst those, who are yet <hi>not independent</hi> in this opinion, and therefore the one may stand with the other.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the consideration of such Arguments which Master <hi>R.</hi> alledgeth against this <hi>Independency</hi> now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>

                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>Let it here be remembred, first, that the difference betwixt Master <hi>R.</hi> and us, is not in <hi>cases,</hi> either of <hi>separation of Churches</hi> one from another; or <hi>speciall restitution</hi> after great defections and apostacies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>But the difference betwixt him and us is here; When</hi> the Churches are compleated with all their Orders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, then it is not in the power of a particular Church to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense Ordination: but <hi>Ordination</hi> is to be acted by a Classis, or Colledge of Pastors, and <hi>that before Election.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Taking this <hi>consideration</hi> along with us, as the conclusion to be proved, <hi>to wit,</hi>
                        <q>Ordination must be dispensed by a Classis of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and that before election.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall readily reply many things; and the rather, because this dish hath been so often set before us, and is brought in as one, in all services almost unto nauseousnesse: referring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to that, which we have formerly writ, we adde here,</p>
                     <p>First, there is not the least shew, in all the Scriptures, of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination before Election,</hi> so dispensed; all the places alledged have not the least appearance of proof of this conclusion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when Churches were compleated with all their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111062:188"/> Officers that then Ordination was acted by a <hi>Colledge of Pastors,</hi> there is not a silable in the text that saith any such thing.</p>
                     <p>Examine we particulars by a sudden survey, and both these will be evident at the first sight.</p>
                     <p>In the first of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there is but <hi>one</hi> Church, and no <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> at all, <hi>"For that is an act of supream jurisdiction,</hi> as Master <hi>R.</hi> But that the Apostles had supream power to call an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, whose calling was immediate, implies a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the Church there was not compleat with Officers, <hi>and the Apostles as extraordinary persons did act there,</hi> as they might in all other Churches that should be erected; therefore this reacheth not our conclusion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. There is no Ordination to Office at all, for the Apostles had their Office before: secondly, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>one</hi> Church (for so the words goe <hi>in the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>) did what was done in an ordinary way; therefore no precedent for the Pastors of many Churches, what they either may, or should do.</p>
                     <p>But that out of <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. how it can be haled in to the purpose in hand, it is beyond my apprehension.</p>
                     <p>First, for there is no mention made of the <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> but <hi>lifting up</hi> the hands.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, here are not Officers of many Congregations compleated, but <hi>Officers</hi> to be made in each particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, here is no act of <hi>Ordination</hi> mentioned but of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and therefore that which is here alledged, was the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> act of <hi>the people,</hi> as all our Divines evince against Papists and Formalists; and the native signification of the word doth evidence, which must needs be here attended.</p>
                     <p>All which considered, thus to reason; If the people of one <hi>Congregation, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordering the action, did choose their Elders; then ordination of Elders before election must be the act of the Pastors of many Congregations: this I say is wide the mark.</p>
                     <p>That of <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. is as far wide, if not further: for,</p>
                     <p>First, it cannot be proved that there were the Elders of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but of <hi>one</hi> Church, as all the casting circumstances carry it.</p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:111062:189"/>
                     <p>Secondly, but certain it is, here is no act of Ordination performed or intended, and therefore nothing concerning that can be concluded.</p>
                     <p>The same is true of <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> If there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of dispute, it must be taken from that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. But it hath been proved before, that here was not an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Officer, because it is beyond the power of ordinary Officers to give being to extraordinary Officers, such as <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> and therefore <hi>his laying on of hands</hi> was like that <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <q>
                           <hi>Master</hi> Ruterford <hi>addes,</hi> If ordination of Pastors in the Word be never given to People or beleevers, or to Ruling Elders, but still to Pastors, as is cleere, <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>5.22.</hi> Tit. <hi>1.5.</hi> Acts <hi>6.6.</hi> Acts <hi>13.3. 2</hi> Tim. <hi>1.6. 1</hi> Tim. <hi>4.14.</hi> And if Ordination be never in the power of one single Pastor (except we bring in a Prelate into the Church,) Then one Pastor with one single Congregation cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise this point of discipline, and so not all points of discipline.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> This argument is the same with the former, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the substance, onely some few places, (which might have been annexed to those that were mentioned before) are here added, which we may consider in the order as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                     <p>To that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. where <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth his Schollar, <hi>To lay on hands rashly on no man:</hi> To <hi>that</hi> also <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the same sence with it; and therfore they both receive the <hi>same Answer:</hi> we say,</p>
                     <p>First, here is <hi>nothing in the Text,</hi> that gives the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of a Classis;</hi> and therefore the authority thereof can by no inference from hence, either be concluded, or confirmed, which is the thing to be proved: but the charge is directed expresly to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in particular.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the manner</hi> how Ordination is to be acted by the one, or Elders to be constituted by the other (for the word is larger in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>) it is <hi>not expresly discovered,</hi> but we are called by the words to look <hi>elsewhere,</hi> for the patterne, by which this practice &amp; proceeding must be ordered in both cases.<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                           </gap>.</note>
                        <hi>As I have appointed thee:</hi> what this <hi>appointment</hi> of the Apostle was, this Text doth not discover; and therfore of this no man can determine it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all the circumstances give in evidence, that <hi>the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111062:189"/> Churches,</hi> touching whose ordering the Apostle here speakes, were <hi>not yet compleated in their Officers,</hi> but being <hi>newly founded</hi> and planted, were to be furnished and perfected with Rulers, by the helpe and direction of <hi>Timothy</hi> in the one, and <hi>Titus</hi> in the other place; and therefore in none of these the question is touched, according to the true nature thereof, as stated before; which is of <hi>Churches furnished with Officers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it cannot be thought in reason, the Apostle would approve, much lesse appoint <hi>another way</hi> of ordaining Elders, then he <hi>himselfe</hi> practised. (I speake to that of <hi>Titus.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> he ordained Elders by <hi>the suffrages of the people,</hi> and <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> them by the helpe of <hi>their fasting and prayer, Acts</hi> 14.23. That is all which is left there upon record; therefore this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> must follow.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, in all those charges, which are directed to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in these Epistles, it never was intended, they should <hi>act them alone,</hi> but ever supposed, they should attend <hi>the order</hi> of Christ in his Churches, and have the concurrence of Officers, and members, in their <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> as the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the actions</hi> did require.</p>
                     <p>When its injoyned <hi>Timothy, That they who sinne, he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke openly,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20.21. <hi>do nothing partially: Teach</hi> he must things appertaining to <hi>wholesome doctrine, Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will any man say, that these duties must not be attended by <hi>all</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of those Churches; and that they should see and provide they might be attended, and stood charged so to doe, as well as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, let us goe no further then the place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>rectifie the things that are wanting.</hi> Imagine there had been <hi>Deacons want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> must <hi>Titus</hi> onely attend that, and none else? and <hi>he</hi> doe it <hi>alone</hi> without all other? Or, that he should, <hi>as a Guide, goe before,</hi> and <hi>see that others acted according to their places?</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to finde out such as were fit to choose, and present them, and had there been Elders in the Church that they should lay on their hands, for the setling and investing of them in their places.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are considered here, <hi>either</hi> as they be <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and so extraordinary persons; and then their actions are not to be made ordinary precedents; or else they are to be considered as expressing common actions of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111062:190"/> which are to continue in the Churches, <hi>with those who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in such power:</hi> and then it will follow, if we force this example, that,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> Timothy <hi>and.</hi> Titus <hi>being particular persons, did put forth such acts of government: the like acts particular Officers may expresse in their particular Congregations.</hi> And hence the inference will be faire against Master <hi>Ruterford</hi> his assertion.</p>
                     <p>As touching that passage <hi>concerning Ruling Elders,</hi> that the ordination of the Pastor is denied unto him, as having no right or power therein; the falsenesse thereof hath beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced sufficiently elsewhere, whether I refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>And from hence also the third allegation receives a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory <hi>Reply;</hi> because indeed, that, which is therein contained doth in no wise conclude the thing to be proved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If Preaching Elders be charged to watch against grievous Wolves, Acts <hi>20.29.</hi> be rebuked, because they suffer them to teach false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Revel. <hi>2.14.</hi> and commended because they try false Teachers, and cast them out, <hi>ver. 2.</hi> If commanded to ordaine faithfull men, and taught whom they should ordaine: Then one Pastor and single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation have not the power of this Discipline.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which for <hi>Reply:</hi> I must needs professe, I can see no ground of reason in the Inference: For, first, those in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. were Elders of one Congregation, as the circumstances of the Text evidence: <hi>secondly,</hi> or suppose they were not; Doth <hi>Paul</hi> injoyne them, that when they are assembled in the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, they should watch against ravening Wolves? or that it doth properly appertaine to them in their speciall charges, wherein they are set as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> and Watchmen in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and particular manner. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> doth not <hi>this watch</hi> in its due proportion, concerne the <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> as well as the <hi>Teaching;</hi> if it be not more especially appertaining to his place, to be as eyes in the wings, to passe up and down in the Assembly, and make inquiry after the first and least stirring of any false opinion, when it is in the very hatching and brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secretly, before it dare shew it selfe, and to give timely intimation to the Teaching Elders to fortifie against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of such evils?</p>
                     <p>And is it not more then plaine, that the <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi> Elders of any particular Congregation, are so farre bound to watch over the flock, that they should by private rebukes stay &amp;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111062:190"/> stop the venting of erronious conceits; and if that will not prevaile, they should then take two or three. If yet they <hi>heare</hi> not, nor will reforme, they should tell it to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and Preach publikely against it, and not suffer them to vent, or others to listen unto, their delusions?</p>
                     <p>Nay lastly, doth not Master <hi>Ruterford</hi> grant, <hi>that the People have power to reject an unworthy Minister;</hi> and therefore may they not try him, hinder him from Teaching, watch against him, and by the mouth <hi>of the Ruling Elder</hi> both publikely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him, and remove him? so that nothing can be inferred from hence, that these acts are peculiar, or appropriate to a Teaching Elder, much lesse to such onely, when they are As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in a Classis. We have done with the first Argument.</p>

                     <q>That government is not of God, nor from the wisedome of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, that deviseth meanes of Discipline to edifie the People; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth meanes of edifying the Elders of every Congregation by the Keyes.

                     <p>There is nothing here, but hath been alledged and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
                     <p>The first part of the Answer makes the question; the proof of the question. <hi>For the conclusion to be proved,</hi> being this; That a particular Congregation cannot exercise, in a right order, all

                     </p>
                     <p>To the second we have spoken at large. Thus much here shall suffice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If by <hi>Overseer</hi> be ment an Officer, it is a meer mistake; for that is, and hath been ever denied. If a <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>brotherly helper</hi> of his reformation, it is such a government which the Word doth not onely allow: <hi>Tell Archippus, Beware of false Teachers;</hi> but its that which all combinations, both civill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticke societies doth of necessity require.</p>

Is not a Pastor a member in the body, a <hi>Brother</hi> as well as a <hi>Father?</hi> and doth not, should not, one member take care, and a memberly oversight each of other? are we not therfore called <hi>Members each of other? Rom.</hi> 12.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>And is it strange to Master <hi>R.</hi> that a Son being in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination or corporation with the Father, should be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to reject his aberations and offences according to the rule of Religion and reason.

                  </p>
                  <p>"Whence this follows: <hi>That every twelve in a private family is this way joyned.</hi>

                        <hi>Family-relation</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Church-relation</hi> is another; they stand by <hi>vertue of divers rules, civill O√´conomicks,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick Politicks;</hi> and therefore though there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many <hi>families,</hi> and that of those that exercise Christian duties together; yet this would not make them a <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His second proof is, <q>Because such a Church hath within it self the power of the Keyes, and is not subject to any superiour Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call jurisdiction.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The force of the proof will appear in the frame of it. <hi>"If an Independent Church hath the power of the Keyes, and is not subject to any other, then it tends to the removall of a publike Ministery.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>proof</hi> is, in the reality of it, the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be proved:</hi> for to be an Independent Church, and to have full power of the exercise of all Ordinances, are all one.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the consequence hath no truth nor strength in it, for the quite contrary followes.</p>
                     <q>Such an Independent Church can call and ordain Officers, and is bound so to do, before she can enjoy some Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</q>
                     <p>For none can consecrate and give the Sacrament, but onely Pastors and Teachers, and therefore those she must provide, before she can partake: and this is the most easie and certain means to provide and so to continue a faithfull ministery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>We have thus set forth the frame of the severals to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; we shall suddenly treat of the particulars, as they are presented in their order, attending them so far, as serves our intended purpose.</p>
               <p>The <hi>work</hi> which is of common concernment unto all the <hi>Members, when the Assembly is dissolved,</hi> is that WATCH which they stand engaged to expresse each to the other, for the good of the body so confederate, <hi>above</hi> or <hi>before all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:111062:193"/>
               <p>First, for though <hi>all Christians</hi> are bound by the <hi>rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> to love and provide for the good of all Christians. Their Honours, Lives, Chastities, Goods, good Names and prosperities, should be precious to us, and we carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them in a way of love: we know it was <hi>Cain's</hi> voice, and argued a <hi>Cains's</hi> heart, <hi>Am I my brother's keeper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet those have a neerer and deeper engagement, and beside the bond of Christianity, have the <hi>bond of Church-confederacy,</hi> which in a peculiar manner engageth the one to the other more then any other Christians in the world; so <hi>Peter</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16. <hi>By the effectuall working of every part, &amp;c.</hi> and it seems to be the care unto which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were enjoyned, <hi>Josh.</hi> 6.18. <hi>And you in any wise keep your selves:</hi> each man himself, and each man his brother; and this watch, neglected, involved all under the same guilt, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.1. the children of <hi>Israel had committed a trespasse:</hi> though <hi>Achan</hi> did it without their privity, yet they were guilty of the sin, in that they had not care to prevent it, by way of watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse each in other, and so in <hi>Achan,</hi> as they should.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as they have a deeper engagement then other, as <hi>Free-men of the same Corporation</hi> have a neerer tye then all the people of the same County: So they have <hi>speciall power one over another,</hi> and that by vertue of the Covenant; for by free and mutuall consent, they who were free to joyn in any other Society, they willingly yeelded themselves unto this, to walk one with another in all the Ordinances of Christ, and to <hi>be subject one unto another,</hi> to be proceeded <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> against, in case they should wrong that society: and <hi>hence</hi> the <hi>processe</hi> that each hath against another accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Brother offend, tell him,</hi> is indeed appropriate and peculiarly intended to <hi>Church-corporation. For</hi> that <hi>Church that can judicially censure and cast out an offender by excommunication,</hi> that <hi>hath power judicially to proceed against him in all the other degrees which may make my there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as</hi> To tell him privately; <hi>and then</hi> Take one or two; <hi>we may admonish others Christianly;</hi> but we can <hi>lay an action and pursue, such as be in combination, judicially onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence,</hi> if I tell another Christian of his fault, if he refuse to hear, I am not necessarily bound to follow <hi>this law</hi> against him; and if I do take one or two to fasten his conviction, if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111062:193"/> he should refuse, I must leave him. But against Brethren we have <hi>expresse law,</hi> by which I am bound to pursue their convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they are bound, and will be necessitated to attend, and either come unto a reformation, or else suffer a just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for their obstinacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence</hi> lastly, by vertue of that engagement by which I am tyed, and the <hi>power</hi> I have received, I stand charged in a most peculiar manner, to prevent alt taint of sin in any Member of the Society, that either it may never be committed; or if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it may speedily be removed, and the spirituall good of the whole preserved: 1 Cor. 5. <hi>Purge out the leven, that ye may be a pure lump;</hi> not that each particular person onely may keep himself pure, but that the whole may be so preserved: and this kind of watch reacheth any, and this kind of processe is good against any of the Members: <hi>Every Brother;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Archippus</hi> and any Elder, if he be a Brother, he is liable hereunto. <hi>This is the watch which we must expresse towards such as be within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the perfecting and encrease of the body, we must attend <hi>such as are to be brought in;</hi> for this being a spirituall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>as</hi> none can be constrained to joyn to it, unlesse <hi>they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> subject; <hi>so</hi> neither can they joyn, unlesse the <hi>body</hi> do as <hi>freely</hi> and willingly entertain them.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>not dwelling</hi> in the same City, Parish or Place, not the <hi>being a subject</hi> in the same Kingdom, that doth interest any in this priviledge: and as the Church can compell none against their wils to joyn, so the <hi>civill Magistrate</hi> should not use any <hi>compulsive</hi> power, or by violent constraint, force the Church to receive, or any to joyn to the Church against their wils.</p>
               <p>The civill power may compell them to come under <hi>the call of God, and attend the Ordinances,</hi> and force them to use means of <hi>information</hi> and <hi>conviction;</hi> that so the Lord Christ may make them glad to seek him in the wayes of his appointment, and more glad to finde him therein: <hi>But</hi> the civill Magistrate is to leave the Church to follow the <hi>rule</hi> of Christ in her <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions;</hi> for it is a <hi>Church-work</hi> to be acted by the <hi>rule of Church-policy,</hi> and therefore should be left to the power of the Church, not constrained by civill power: <hi>Christ's people are a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> faith is not forced.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111062:194"/>
               <p>In the ADMISSIONS, two things are to be attended; First, <hi>what is to be done before</hi> they come; Secondly, <hi>what there, when</hi> they are come into the Assembly.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Before the Assembly,</hi> that the proceeding may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on comely and orderly, the person that desires to joyn himself Member with the Church, he is to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire known to the <hi>Ruling Elder or Elders;</hi> for it's peculiar to his Office to lead the action of Admission, it being a work that fals not within the compasse of <hi>labouring in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The desire of the party made known, he is then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire diligently, and carefully to inform himself, touching the <hi>uprightnesse of the persons carriage</hi> and conversation from the <hi>testimony of others,</hi> who know him intimately, and will in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son deale nakedly and sincerely therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must take notice by way of conference, what his knowledge and acquaintance is with the things of Christ and his Kingdom: the <hi>reason why</hi> he should thus inform himself, is this, Because hereby the party may discover, and he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>whether he be a visible Saint to the judgment of reasonable chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which we have formerly proved to be attended necessarily according to the rules of Christ, and the right constitution of his Churches.</p>
               <p>And Master <hi>R.</hi> his own grounds and grants will infer as much, by force of dispute; for if they who are to be admitted must be <hi>void of scandall</hi> in their course, and freed also from <hi>grosse ignorance,</hi> which in some cases, by Master <hi>R.</hi> his own confession will unchurch them: there must then be serious enquiry made, whether the persons who tender themselves to enter into this condition, be so qualified.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The</hi> profession <hi>which Master</hi> R. <hi>requires, is of that</hi> quality, That it notifies to the Church, that there is saving faith in the hearts of such, and that they be invisible Saints, who desire to joyn themselves to a visible Congregation, <hi>l. 2. p. 196.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Church is bound in an orderly way to inform her self touching such fitnesse, least she break the rules of Christ, and bring pollution and so ruine upon the whole.</p>
               <p>After the Elder hath informed himself in the particulars formerly mentioned, he then sees way and warrant to <hi>propound</hi> the desires of such to the Church, that <hi>they</hi> also may <hi>use their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111062:194"/> best information</hi> by their own experience, and take in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of others, to be fully informed and satisfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unblamablenesse of their conversation.</p>
               <p>And as for that, that the Memb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>rs should at severall times, by several companies; repair in <hi>private</hi> to them, to examine the <hi>work</hi> &amp; <hi>manner of their conversion,</hi> I am afraid it is a <hi>presumed kinde of liberty,</hi> which wants precept and example, for any thing that ever appeared to me in the Scripture. <hi>Beside,</hi> that liberty is as much as the office and duty of the Elder bind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and therefore seems to entrench too neer upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his place. <hi>Beside,</hi> all such pains misseth the end and fruit of it; for the stresse of the tryall lyes not there, nor can the last resolution of judicious and reasonable charity issue there, whether the person be a visible Saint or no: fot there be many truly and savingly called, who <hi>never knew the time and manner of their conversion,</hi> and therefore cannot relate it unto others, and yet expresse the power of grace in their lives, and consequently had it effectually wrought in their hearts, though they did not <hi>at the first</hi> know how the spirit breathed in their birth.</p>
               <p>Time of enquiry being thus granted, if upon serious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation &amp; consideration, the Brethren find any just exception, as touching any scandal in their carriage, and after dealing with them, they can receive no reality of satisfaction, they repair to the Elder, leave their complaint with him, and that is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to stay the proceeding for the present.</p>
               <p>But if upon sufficient time of information, there appears nothing scandalous, the person doth shortly <hi>give some reason of his hope</hi> in the face of the Congregation, &amp; is admitted, <hi>Ingaging himself to walk with them in the Covenant of the Church, according to all the rules of the Gospel, that either are or shall be made known to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be here enquired, <hi>What is the rule according to which satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is to be regulated,</hi> the Reader may be pleased to look back unto that which was largely debated, touching the visibility of the Saints, what it was which evidenced them to <hi>rationall charity.</hi> In a word, if a person live <hi>not in the commissions of any known sin,</hi> nor <hi>in the neglect of any known duty,</hi> and <hi>can give a reason of his hope towards God,</hi> this casts the cause, with judicious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to hope and beleeve there is something <hi>of God and grace in the soul,</hi> and therefore fit for Church-society.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111062:195"/>
               <p>And that thus much is required, hath been demonstrated from Master <hi>R.</hi> his own principles; and that thus much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired is undeniable by the rules of right reason: for he that lives in known omissions of duty, or commission of sin, he professeth himself by that practice, not willing to submit to the rules of Christ, and therefore not fit to be his subject, or to enjoy the priviledge of his kingdom, which reveals the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Scepter: Nay, by such a practice he professeth to persist, and to be pertinacious in sin, and therefore in case he was in the Church, he was fit to be cast out and censured, not worthy, then, to be received.</p>
               <p>This rule being received and agreed upon, it would mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailously facilitate the work of <hi>Admission,</hi> without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and prevent such curious inquisitions and niceties, which the pride and wantonnesse of mens spirits hath brought into the Church, to disturb the peace thereof, and to prejudice the progresse of God's Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Hence also those sottish pangs would presently be calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when persons complain they <hi>cannot joyn with such and such,</hi> and yet cannot shew a just exception: he that joyns with the rule in his practice, he who hath but a teachable and meek self-denying heart, he will easily joyn with him. <hi>This is the manner of receiving men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>What difference is there in receiving‚ñ™ Women,</hi> (you will say) <hi>whether any, or none at all?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true, women are forbidden <hi>to speak in the Church, (i. e.)</hi> by way of <hi>Teaching;</hi> but they may so speak, when their <hi>speeches</hi> argue <hi>subjection,</hi> and so suit with their sexes; as to give in <hi>testimony of repentance,</hi> in case they were <hi>consured,</hi> and came to be restored again, so to answer a question propounded to them; yet because we find it by experience, the feeblenesse of some, their shamefac't modesty and melanchollick fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is such, that they are not able to expresse themselves in the face of a Congregation, and yet have the precious work of saving grace in their hearts, we are forced to take the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of such in private,</hi> and <hi>make report of them to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and since this was necessary for some, and warrantable for all, <hi>it's most without exception to receive all after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> that so the infirmities of the weakest may be releeved, and the seeming exceptions of others also may be prevented.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:111062:195"/>
               <p>The last <hi>Question</hi> belonging to the head of Admission, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether those that are dismissed from other Congregations, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily make their confession afresh? or whether recommendations be sufficient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>answer</hi> by the DIRECTIONS following:</p>
               <p>First, the <hi>testimony</hi> of any <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> ought to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>according to the worth of it,</hi> and received with all the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that is due to the Spouse of Christ; and therefore if by the testimony of two or three Witnesses, every word comes to be established, much more when any report or relation comes from so many in such a relation, we should sit down satisfied with the truth thereof, as with out the least suspition, as that the thing is sufficiently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the <hi>highest evidence</hi> of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that can be given, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.18. <hi>The Brother whose praise is through all the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, yet because the <hi>Churches may decline</hi> in regard of their practice, and walk at a <hi>greater breadth of liberty,</hi> either in respect of their <hi>actions,</hi> or of their <hi>opinions,</hi> then others can, and they indeed should; and because when they have used all the care and watchfulnesse they can, to search into the walks and wayes of their Members, yet others that meet with them in their daily and occasionall converse, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily see more and discern more then they can. Each Church hath her liberty to follow the light of the Word, and the rule thereof, which will not erre, nor can deceive; rather then to sit downe meerely with the allowance of men, but use their own search and care: and if upon enquiry and observation, either they shall appear <hi>scandalous</hi> in their lives, or <hi>erronious</hi> in their judgments and opinions, and those <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>infectious;</hi> it is then left in the power of the Church, to require humiliation answerable to the offences, and to exact a profession and confession of the truth, and an open renunciation of such errours before they be received, because the care both for the reformation of the party, and the preservation of the Church in purity of life &amp; doctrine is hereby attained: So <hi>Paul</hi> advised against those <hi>ravening wolves</hi> Acts 20.30. and the <hi>Disciples</hi> were mervailously cautious to meddle with <hi>Paul</hi> after his conversion, before they were fully
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111062:196"/> satisfied by some testimony, whereby their fears might be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26. and not only in these cases, but in any other, the Churches have liberty to seek satisfaction that may suit their hearts according to rule, as requiring some <hi>report of the work of God in them,</hi> and the frame of their spirits towards him.</p>

               <p>WE have done with <hi>Admission;</hi> we are now with the same brevity to enquire touching the DISPENSATION OF THE SACRAMENTS, which are the <hi>Brand</hi> of God's sheep, the <hi>Livery</hi> of his houshold-servant: for amongst many other ends of the Sacraments, this is one, that it's a brand-mark, and a separating note of the sheep of God's fold and <hi>such as are without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's constantly to be observed in the Scriptures, how God's people have been judged to be priviledged by these seals, and how they rejoyced in them, as peculiarly appropriated to them: <hi>He hath not dealt so with any Nation,</hi> so <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What is the priviledge of the Jew? much every way.</hi> And these are of the chiefest of them. Nay, the Lord expresly forbad any <hi>stranger</hi> to meddle with the <hi>Passeover,</hi> Exod. 12.48. And how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the <hi>Jew</hi> known by <hi>Circumcision?</hi> as though the priviledge came to be their <hi>proper name,</hi> Ephes. 2.11, 12. and therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called <hi>uncircumcision by them who were called circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:111062:196"/>
               <p>First, for them <hi>who have right to administer</hi> the Sacraments; and these are called thereunto by God's command, the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and designation of the Church, viz. <hi>Pastors and Teachers</hi> onely; none else, as formerly we have proved: Commission is given to them authoritatively to <hi>preach</hi> the Covenant, and therefore by the same authority to dispense the <hi>seals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a frenzy of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> which begins to labour with the loathsomnesse of it self, <hi>That any Christian gifted, who can teach or administer a word of instruction to win a disciple after him, that he in a corner may baptize him also whom he hath won to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi> But as <hi>Paul</hi> said of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres, Their, madnesse is made to appear to all,</hi> who are not willing to shut their eyes against the Sun, when it shines in its beauty.</p>
               <p>For if the Lord Christ in his infinite wisdom &amp; kingly care, conceived it necessary for the honour of the place, &amp; the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the <hi>work of a Deacon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 6.</note> to appoint <hi>choice</hi> men and solemn <hi>Ordination to authorize them to the work,</hi> that they being called and fitted to the work, might be accepted therein of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and blessed by him, who did appoint them to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. In reason, <hi>what greater need is there,</hi> that persons who are peculiarly gifted and furnished with grace and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, should be called to this <hi>work of preaching, and dispensing these holy Mysteries;</hi> a service above all other of greatest weight and worth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, adde hereunto, that the Apostle as by a flaming sword, doth stop the way to all pretenders, and therefore lays in this prohibition, <hi>No man taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as Aaron.</hi> He must have a speciall <hi>call</hi> from God, who must dare to meddle with a <hi>service</hi> which is of such <hi>peculiar</hi> eminence in the house of God; yea, the Lord himself doth appropriate this, and that unto some persons whom he puts into place: <hi>He gave some to be Pastors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>Are all Apostles? are all Governours? are all Teachers? &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.29. This would bring confusion, and so destruction to the whole.</p>
               <p>These are the persons <hi>who have received right from Christ to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister;</hi> we are now to enquire,</p>
               <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Who be the parties who have right by rule and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Christ to receive?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:111062:197"/>
               <p>And here it's agreed of all hands; Such who are come to ripenesse of yeers, and are rightly received, and so stand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the true visible Church of Christ; <hi>such,</hi> I say, have title to <hi>all the seals</hi> of the Covenant: being to the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only really within the Covenant of Grace; but truly also within the compasse of the Covenant of the <hi>Church:</hi> We will not therefore trouble our selves to prove that which hath approbation of all.</p>
               <p>But rather trade in that which is attended with the greatest difficulty, and findes strong opposition, according to the strength of mens affections and apprehensions, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged either way: There is then a <hi>two-fold-question,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth the hearts, thoughts and pens of the most judicious at this day.</p>
               <p>First, betwixt <hi>us and the Anabaptists,</hi> who willingly admit all Members of the true Church to both the seals, <hi>but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of all those Members,</hi> they wholly exclude from partaking of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> untill they come to yeers of discretion, when they make actuall profession of their faith, then they may actually share in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, betwixt us and Master <hi>Ruterford;</hi> for we concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that <hi>confederating</hi> makes persons members of visible Churches; those who are <hi>not confederate</hi> we conceive <hi>no members</hi> of a visible Church: and therefore in <hi>that condition,</hi> they have <hi>no right,</hi> nor in a right order can challenge the benefits or priviledges of Members, nor <hi>can any officer in a right order</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense them unto such: Should an Officer by any power of his Office, attempt to exercise any authority, and therefore to enjoyn such a person, <hi>Non-member,</hi> to come, to hear, to receive, he may justly refuse the command, and he cannot proceed against him, if he should refuse: Nay, did he persist obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject his authority, he could not convent him before the Assembly and cast him out of the body, who was never in the body: <hi>And if an Officer have no authority to require him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the seal, no more hath he power to require the Officer to give the seal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Questions</hi> then which offer themselves to our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this place, are these two principally.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Whether Infants of such who are Members of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be baptized?</hi> and this we affirm against the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:111062:197"/> and refer the Reader to the <hi>Treatises penned by judicious</hi> Writers to this purpose.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Which is of greatest difficulty, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires most serious search and consideration is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the Infants of Non-confederates, who refuse to be Members of the Church, should be partakers of Baptisme, which is one of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priviledges of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, we shall set down the <hi>state of the Question,</hi> least we should misse the right understanding of the cause by some mistakes. Secondly, we will lay down some <hi>Conclusions,</hi> which may lead the Reader by the hand, to look unto the grounds which yet keep us in this apprehension. Lastly, we shall <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the arguments</hi> which are made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>To find the right <hi>basis</hi> to <hi>bottome</hi> the Question, we must know, that we now dispute <hi>not about the wickednesse</hi> of men, while they remain <hi>Members</hi> of the Congregations, as though that could <hi>prejudice</hi> their priviledge, while they <hi>remain</hi> in that state and relation.</p>
               <p>True, <hi>this wickednesse</hi> justly <hi>deserves</hi> they should be <hi>proceeded against,</hi> eitheir to be reformed or removed: but <hi>if the Church</hi> either through <hi>connivence, negligence</hi> or <hi>indulgence,</hi> shall <hi>tolerate sinfully such evils</hi> and evil persons in that estate of Membership, they <hi>cannot</hi> then <hi>deny</hi> them the <hi>priviledge of Members;</hi> So that while the <hi>Prophets prophesied lyes,</hi> and the <hi>Priests ruled by their means, and the people would have it so,</hi> and grew corrupt while they were members (though corrupt members) they did share in the <hi>Passeover,</hi> and their children were made partakers of <hi>Circumcision:</hi> So those of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of whom the spirit speaks expresly, <hi>they were dead, though they had a name to live;</hi> as long as the Church, through her carelesnesse, kept them in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, it's certain their children might and did partake of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as one of the Church priviledges.</p>
               <p>It's not then the Question, <hi>Whether wicked Members, while they are tolerated sinfully in the Church, they and their children may partake of the priviledges?</hi> for this is beyond question; nor do I know, nor yet ever heard it denied by any of ours; and therefore all the Arguments alledged by Master <hi>R.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 12. are all granted without any losse to our, either opinion or practice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>pinch</hi> then of the <hi>Questlon</hi> lyes here, Whether persons <hi>non confederate,</hi> and so (in our sense not <hi>Members of the Church</hi>)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111062:198"/> do entitle their children to the seal of Baptisme, being one of the Priviledges of the Church, their Parents (though godly) being yet unwilling to come into Church-fellowship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lubricus hic locus &amp; difficilis;</hi> and that I may <hi>shrive</hi> my heart to the Reader and Master <hi>R.</hi> I shall nakedly professe, that if I should have given way to my affection, or followed that which suits my secret desire and inclination, I could have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly wished, that the scale might have been cast upon the affirmative part, and that such persons (many whereof we hope are godly) might enjoy all such priviledges, which might be usefull and helpfull to them and theirs.</p>
               <p>But after all the stones I have turned, and the thoughts that I have spent in this kinde, there be some reasons which yet arrest my understanding, and causeth me yet to make a defence for this cause, and the main pillar principle which fortifies the judgement against all approaching assaults, is the nature and truth of <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> in which I must professe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am yet more confirmed, as I have been constrained to take it into more serious consideration; and the best of all those Arguments that men (of such eminency, and worth, and learning, that my heart doth highly reverence, according to their righteous desert) have raised to make a breach upon that part of the Discipline, which like bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s in the building, binds all the parts together, have rather strengthned then stirred my judgement.</p>
               <p>Let me here again crave leave to propound such thoughts as I have without offence, that I may (<hi>cotis vicem supplere,</hi> and) occasion such whom God hath furnished with greater light, to cleer this cause and coast more fully then ever yet I had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to see, to the satisfaction of my judgment: and we do here in the estating of these priviledges, as Lawyers use to do in the setling of Inheritances, enquire where the first right lies, and how it comes lineally and lawfully to be derived and established upon such and such parties; and this we shall doe by enquiring the Pedegree in the conveyance of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in the following conclusions.</p>

                  <p>But that all Children of all Nations, Turks, Pagans, &amp;c. should be admitted unto the priviledge, is absurd: <hi>Quosvis Infantes ad Baptismum admitti in toto vetere ecclesi√¢ in auditum esse, &amp;c.</hi> Beza in cap. 7. primae ad <hi>Corinth.</hi> v. 14. and this Master <hi>R.</hi> grants.</p>

                     <hi>that belongs to all other by right received from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it lay first there:</hi> the evidence of the terms and former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication gives in full evidence of this: <hi>but the next Parents can give the priviledge and title to Baptisme without any help of the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors:</hi> As suppose they were all dead, or all without any knowledge or remembrance, were apostates from the Gospel, or opposers of it; yet the next Parents fearing God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federating in the Covenant of the Gospel, they do and can give right to their Children to share in this priviledge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help from Predecessors. Therefore the right is not firstly in them, nor is firstly conveyed by them.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:111062:199"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That which belongs</hi>

                     </gap>
                     <hi>and firstly to the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, that they can do without the next Parents:</hi> otherwise they should not assoon have their hand in the conveyance of this right, as those to whom it did firstly appertain, and so it should not belong to them firstly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Predecessors cannot convey this right without the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:</hi> for it's that <hi>paterna potestas</hi> which belongs to them, to dispose of their own. If they will depart and goe from under all Church-power, and depart into places where there be no Churches: Or lastly, if both the next Parents were apostates, it's not in the power of all former Predecessors to bring the Childe to the enjoyment of this priviledge: so that if the next Parents be <hi>causa adaequata</hi> of entituling their Children to such spirituall advantages, then it belongs to them alone firstly.</p>
                  <p>But so they are: It's in their power, though all other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors should oppose, to give right; it's in their power, though all other Predecessors should endeavour it, yet to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deprive their Children of the right; for their aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy takes off the <hi>federall holinesse</hi> of the Children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is (I cannot conceive but it is) a misapprehension and misapplication of that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. because God hath promised, that <hi>he will shew mercy to a thousand generations of them that love him, and keep his Commandements;</hi> that therefore the Predecessors, though far removed, can entitle Children unto Baptisme, though their next Parents be such, who never love God, nor keep his Commandements; nay, be happily apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and excommunicates.</p>
                  <p>We will weigh a little the sense of the words, and the strength of the inference that is made therefrom, so far as it concerns our cause in hand.</p>
                  <p>The current of Orthodox Interpreters carry the meaning of the Text this way; The Lord in the threatning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise discovers the jealousie of his heart towards such as be professed worshippers of him: namely.</p>
                  <p>He is so tender of his honour in this case, which so neerly concerns him, as the conjugall affection of Matrimonial faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse doth the husband from the behaviour of his wife and Spouse, that out of jealousie he is ready and resolved to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111062:199"/> all falsnesse, and to reward faithfulnesse in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the expression of his jealousie, he is more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and unwilling to execute his anger against such, who offend in the breach of his worship: but more enlarged in the discovery of his love and goodnesse to such, who shall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjugall fidelity towards him therein; and therefore the certain numbers of the third and fourth, and thousands of Generations are here put for the large and uncertain extent of his displeasure to the one, and his kindnesse to the other; and therefore,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord doth not tye himself strictly to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar law or allowance in this case, but walks in a breadth, as it best beseems his wisdome and good pleasure; and hence he doth exempt some in the third or fourth Generation from his threatning and punishment,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.23.</note> and doth also with-hold the expressions of his love from others in the thousand men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the threatning, and so inflicting of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.9, 13</note> it is ever in his order and manner; namely, those who imitate the sin of their idolatrous Parents, those may expect, and shall certainly suffer their plagues: they who imitate the love and obedience of their faithfull Parents,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.27, 30.</note> they may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured they shall receive the mercies promised to their Parents in the footsteps of whose faith they persist.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the mercy here promised is not so to be conceived as though all the particular blessings or priviledges that the Parents were possessed of, shall in the severals be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to their Children; for we know it contrary by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: The Israelites wanted Circumcision by the space of forty yeers in the Wildernesse; and in the time of the Judges,<note place="margin">Judges 5.8.</note> and the seventy yeers Captivity, the Israelites were destitute of severall priviledges, which they were made partakers of when they enjoyed peace and prosperity in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Mercy here is that saving mercy, which God never fails to bestow on his Elect, grace here, and glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, reserving a variety of dispensations, in regard of divers priviledges or benefits, as seems best to the counsell of his own will.</p>
                  <p>This being the received meaning of the words, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of judicious Interpreters, <hi>Calvin, Zanchy, Junius,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111062:200"/> Perkins,</hi> in secundum praeceptum. What inference can hence be made for the conveyance of the right of Baptisme from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Parents to Children, I must confesse I cannot conceive: For the Generations the Lord promiseth to shew mercy unto must be such who imitate their godly Parents, by loving and obeying his Commandements, and especially that of the truth of his worship: and how doth this agree to Infants, who are not yet capable, being not come to yeers to put forth such acts?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon this grant, and the making of this ground good, <hi>ubi standum,</hi> where there will be a stop or stay made, I cannot see: for if a thousand Generations more or lesse have interest in Baptisme by vertue of their fore-fathers, who were faithfull within that compasse then the children of Turks or Jews can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excluded this priviledge and ordinance: some of their Predecessors are comprehended, without all question, within the bounds of a thousand Generations there mentioned, and yet all those Infants are excluded by their own confession, and by the peremptory and plain affirmation of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. through unbelief the naturall boughes were cut off from Church and Church priviledges.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take a new convert soundly brought home to Christ, yet through his weaknesse, not able to <hi>discern the Lord's Body</hi> aright; would this be a good dispute?</p>
                  <p>If God shew mercy to a thousand Generations, then this man, who had some godly Predecessors, he may be admitted to partake of the Lords Supper: and if this be a weak collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as each man will yeeld at the first sight, then the inference of Baptisme upon the like ground, must have the like feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it: Nay, why an excommunicate may not upon this ground plead the partaking of the Sacrament, professing the true faith, but onely censured for such a practice; especially, conceive him to be within God's election, I cannot see. God shewes mercy, and so the priviledge of a Sacrament, to such who had godly Predecessors within the compasse of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand generations: but I had godly Predecessors within that compasse, therefore I have title to that mercy, and so to the priviledge of the Sacrament: this conclusion all men reject, and therefore they must also refuse the former collection.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111062:200"/> the right of Baptisme to their Children; hence it followes inevitably, That Children may either be deprived or possessed of priviledges, by means of the sinfulnesse or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their Parents, and that in a way of God's most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proceeding; I say most righteous, because the parity and proportion is most exact on both hands.</p>
                  <p>The faithfull covenant of the Parents doth as fully entitle them, and so advantage them in the priviledges thereof;<note place="margin">Deut. 29.11.</note> as the carelesse rejecting of the Covenant doth disadvantage and debar them from the enjoying of the fruit and benefit of such speciall means.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And since it is confessed of all hands, and is most apparent in that Text, that temporall benefits are dispensed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unto undeserving children, for the faith and piety of their godly Parents; as unto <hi>Ismael</hi> for <hi>Abraham's, Esau</hi> for <hi>Jacob's</hi> sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.11. &amp; 21.13. and so frequently we have it recorded and repeated, <hi>Yet for my servant David's sake I will do so and so.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence Parents must first have right themselves, before they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it unto theirs; and they can deprive them of no more then they can give them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There be two branches of the Conclusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, a Parent must have a right before he can give it: A man must stand possessed of an interest in a title to a priviledge before he can make over that unto another; otherwise he should give that he hath not, and the claim of the other is voyd, and his expectation will wholly fail him, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>cause his challenge of his interest is from one that had none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can receive none from him: <hi>a non habente potestatem,</hi> acts are frustrate, sayes the Lawyer.</p>
                  <p>And this is the order of God's proceeding with his people,<note place="margin">Deut. 29 9, 10</note>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:111062:201"/> and that according to the rules of infinite wisdom and justice:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14. Rom. 11.17.</note> the Parent enters into Covenant for himself and his seed, so that Children are within the Covenant, because they came from Parents within the Covenant; in which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and so received also by God.</p>
                  <p>And upon this ground its certain, That an excommunicate Parent cannot entitle any of his children to a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>That right he hath not, he cannot give, <hi>ex concessis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he hath no right or title to any Sacrament; for by the consent of all, he is cast out from any such communion: and therefore it's certain he cannot convey that right to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Being thus a little helped, by these conclusions premised and proved, to see where the right firstly lyes, and whereby children come to be entituled to the Priviledges; and how it comes, according to the rules and laws of Christ, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.</p>
                  <p>Let us now enquire what force those Arguments have, which are alledged to the contrary. All the Reasons brought by Master <hi>R.</hi> in his first book, do not at all reach the Question in hand, as it hath appeared in the stating of it; and therefore they are all granted without any gain to him, or losse to us.</p>
                  <p>Others which are alledged to this end, I find in two places, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 186. &amp; <hi>p.</hi> 262.</p>
                  <p>In the former place we have these allegations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We hold, that those who are not members of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, may lawfully be admitted to the Seals of the Covenant; first, because those to whom the promises are made, and professe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, these should be baptized: but men of approved piety are such, though they be not members of a particular Parish. The Proposition is Peters <hi>argument,</hi> Acts 2.38.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Proposition is denied, because there is more to fit for the receiving of the Seals, then to professe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to have the promise of grace made to men.</p>
                  <p>We find Master <hi>R.</hi> confessing, That an excommunicate for some notorious facts, or for pertinacy in some practicall evil, may yet professe all the truth of the Gospel; nay, may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious, and therefore hath all the promises in that kind appertaining to him, and yet have no title to a Sacrament, by his own confession, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 232.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111062:201"/>
                  <p>The place of the <hi>Acts</hi> gives no confirmation, because, first, these were Jewes and Proselites, who were in visible Church-state: And secondly, it's to be observed, that though that Church-state gave ground of their Baptizing, yet by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle his dispute, they must come at this Ordinance, according to Christ his method and manner: So that unlesse they had taken this way, they had not followed the direction of the Apostle, nor would he in reason have admitted them to the partaking of that Ordinance; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Those who are not members of a particular Church, may be visible Professors, and so members of the visible Church; therefore the seals of the Covenant belongeth unto them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The frame at full stands thus:</p>

                  <p>But all visible Professors, though not members of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, are members of the visible Church in generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both parts of the Reason fail, for there are no such mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Church in generall: Secondly, those whom Master <hi>R.</hi> conceives such, to many of them the seals of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant do not belong, by his confession, as to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates: and I may adde also; according to his opinion, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons, who by his grant, are not to be entertained as members with any particular Congregation, and therefore not into communion with them, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>

                        </gap>ion</hi> also is to be denyed: for it would bring in a new devised kind of membership, which neither the rule of reason, nor the constitution of a visible Church will admit; <hi>to wit,</hi> to be a member of the visible Church in generall, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d yet be no member of any particular Congregation: for,</p>
                  <p>First, take all particular Congregations in their full enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration and induction, they are all the members whereof the visible catholick Church is made up, as an Integrum of all his parts.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:111062:202"/>
                  <p>Those who are not members of any particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, come not within the rank, nor can be referred to any kind of members of a visible Church: But all the members that constitute the visible, are therein contained. And it is all one, as if a man should say, there be two parts or members that make up an entire man, and yet there may be a member of a man which is neither comprehended, nor can be referred to either of these, which is in truth to speak daggers.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is a fundamentall rule of reason, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature of any thing hath its existing, and so its working in the particulars; the whole nature of manhood or humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it exists and works in the particulars and individuals of <hi>John, Thomas, Richard, Jeremy,</hi> that are now in being upon the face of the earth; and therefore to affirm, there should be any part of manhood or humanity yet not existing in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, is to forge a thing in a man's fancy without any reality at all: To be a member of the visible Church in the generall, and yet to have no particular existence of membership in any particular Congregation, is a meer conceit, which comes out of the same mint, crosse to the principles of reason.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is a conclusion unto which Master <hi>R.</hi> hath given his full consent, That known scandals are ground sufficient to exclude a person otherwise professing the Covenant, from being a visible member of a Church (<hi>lib.</hi> 2.243, 251.) and so by parity of reason exclude him from being a member of any the visible Churches on earth.</p>
                  <p>He that is justly excluded the membership, and so the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of all the particular Congregations on earth, he is justly excluded from partaking of any priviledges by their means.</p>
                  <p>But a person may be a visible Professor, and yet be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Membership, and so fellowship with all the visible Churches on earth, <hi>ex concessis,</hi> and therefore he may have such a profession, and be excluded justly from all priviledges which may come by their means.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Qualification</hi> of such who come unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be attended in a <hi>double respect:</hi> first, as they stand in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111062:203"/>
                     <hi>relation to God,</hi> and the worthy partaking of the Ordinance, and then <hi>God requires,</hi> and also the Ordinance cals for <hi>inward truth.</hi> Secondly, as they stand in reference and <hi>relation to the Church,</hi> and their outward dispensation of them, and then <hi>that profession which intimates sincerity,</hi> so far as the judgement of <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall charity</hi> shall require, is sufficient, because the Church can judge <hi>the tree</hi> (onely) <hi>by the fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. <q>God, upon this grant, hath warranted his Church to put his seal upon a falshood, and to confer the seals upon Infants, for the externall profession of faith, where there is no faith at all: This the Writers think inconvenient and absurd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>consequence is denied,</hi> as not having a colour of truth: for the <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>warrantably give</hi> the Seals to such, who doe <hi>unworthily</hi> receive them; the Church judging things according to rules of Charity: She knowes not who are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits, but is bound to judge otherwise, if they appear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and therefore the Church in dispensing the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the alme and work of the Ordinances (according to their nature) is to seal up the truth of the Covenant. If un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receivers deal falsly with God and his Ordinances, abuse them, and pervert their work, and partake unworthily of the seal of Baptisme; (as many eat and drink their own damnation in abusing Christ's Body and Blood) their fin and guilt lyes upon their own head; God and the Church are free from both: And this none of ours, nor M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>R.</hi> his Writers once gainsay; only <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Familists</hi> cast in such cavils: and yet those, I mean of the Familists, who have not forsaken the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of men, nor laid aside the forehead of modesty, are forced to yeeld as much in their own way; for no man thinks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he desires wilfully to blind and delude himself, that when all <hi>Jerusalem, Judea,</hi> and all the coasts about <hi>Jordan,</hi> came to be baptized of <hi>John,</hi> that all these had the reality of faith in their hearts. This is cleer according to our principles.</p>
                  <p>But how Master <hi>R.</hi> will quit his hands of this Objection, according to the rules of his proceeding, I confesse I cannot tell: for when he affirmeth, lib. 2. p. 260. <q>That we are not to cast any out for non-regeneration, even known.</q> If not cast out non-regenerates, then give them the seals; and then the Church gives such the seals whom she knowes, out of reason and charity, have no title; and she is guilty of sealing a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:111062:203"/>
                  <p>Obj. 3. <q>∆≤pon this ground it followes, that Excommunicates children are in no better case by this Doctrine, then the children of Turks and Infidels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If in some particulars, Excommunicates are equall with Turks &amp; Infidels, <hi>let him he as a heathen,</hi> it's no wonder; nor yet crosse to any reason, that in such particulars <hi>their children also should share with them;</hi> those inc≈çveniences coming by the breach of Covenant, when the keeping of it would have procured the c≈çtrary comforts &amp; priviledges. Look at the particular enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the priviledges, they are so far alike, have like title thereunto: though the advantages of the one be far greater thƒì the other in many regards. As should a man reason thus; If he that is a member of a Church, and yet not able to examine himself, hath no right to partake of the seals of the Supper, (as the expresse word of Text testifies) then such in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular are no better then Turks. The Answer would be easie, in point of <hi>Non-right</hi> they are alike, that is equally affirmed of both: but <hi>in other priviledges</hi> and advantages which look that way, they are <hi>far differing</hi> one from the other.</p>
                  <p>These are all the reasons I find, <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> in Master <hi>R.</hi> which fully reach the cause.</p>
                  <p>We shall now, beside the grounds formerly given for expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and which served mainly for the cleering and setling of this truth, <hi>offer some Reasons to the</hi> consideration of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so leave this so difficult a head of Discipline.</p>
                  <p>First, its confessed on all hands, that Baptisme is a previledge of the Church either Catholike or particular, and therefore "<hi>not to be found nor injoyed but in the Church,</hi> as Master <hi>R.</hi> lib. 1. p. 175. and therefore <hi>as Circumcision</hi> of old was counted the <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God's houshold-servants, and brand of the sheep of his flock,</hi> to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and distinguish them who were Aliens from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> Eph. 2.12. <hi>so is Baptisme now</hi> in the time of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it hath been proved in the conclusions forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that onely the next Parent can convey this priveledge: upon which premises partly agreed, partly proved, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment issues thus:</p>
                  <div n="1" type="argument">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> I.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They who have no right to Baptisme, they ought not to receive it:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111062:204"/> But children of Non-confederates have no right;</hi> which is thus evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced: All the right which such have, is from the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as in the <hi>third conclusion;</hi> but the next Parents non-confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate can give no right; for that right which they have not, they cannot give: but non-confederates are non-members of the Church, and the seals are a Church priveledge: and hence they having no right to Church priveledges, therefore cannot give them. Or more briefly thus;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Non-members of the Church have no right to the priviledges of the Church, and so can give none.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But non-confederats Parents, are non-members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second part of the reason,</hi> where all the difficulty lyes, hath been formerely evinced, when we disputed of the form of a Church, and that which gave formality to the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whether we refer the Reader, to what hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as the truth of God, <hi>That confederation gives formality to a Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But these children who were externally in Covenant and born of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Parents were only to be Circumcised,</hi> Gen. 17.10. Master <hi>R.</hi> lib. 1. p. 165.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>R.</hi> answereth to the Proposition, <q>
                           <hi>That the Covenant there mentioned was the Covenant of grace, but ours is the Covenant of the Church,</hi> lib. 2.202.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> It is true, the Covenant of grace is ever inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and presupposed in the Covenant of the Church, and so in this place: but that which is here attended in the ultimate consideration is the Covenant of the Church, wherewith the Covenant of grace was cloathed, and that appeares by this reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Covenant is here nderstood that gives full right unto Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:111062:204"/> (as by comparing Gen 17.7, 10. will fully appeare) and <hi>so unto all other priviledges in their order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the Covenant of grace doth not give full right unto Circumcision.</hi> For <hi>Job</hi> and all his friends were in the Covenant of Grace, and yet neither Circumcision nor Passeover did appertain to them, nor yet to any other people upon earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. therefore it is a mistake of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                        <hi>R.</hi> when he affirms the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth that help much which he alledged, that <q>Iob and his friends did sacrifice which was peculiar to the Iews.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a mistake: sacrificing was before the flood, and immediately after in <hi>Noah</hi> his time, and therefore could not be appropriated to the Jewes, but as it was <hi>peculiarly circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> according to God's appointment.</p>
                     <p>Nor do those expressions carry any weight, when Master <hi>R.</hi> affirmes, <q>That the Covenant in generall was made with Infants of eight dayes old: and our Covenant is not made with Infants.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The affirmation is a great mistake; for we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine according to truth, that the beleeving Parent Covenants and confesses for himself and his posterity.

                     <p>Is taken from <hi>Romans</hi> 11.17. there the holy Apostle discovers the mind of God touching the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-priviledges to the Gentiles, and he sets it down under this fimilitude; <hi>If thou, being a wilde Olive, wert grafted in amongst them, and with them partakest of the fatnesse of the Olive tree.</hi> The <hi>Olive</hi> is the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, <hi>visible</hi> in her profession: the <hi>engrafting</hi> is <hi>entring into visible fellowship</hi> with her: the <hi>fatnesse</hi> of this Olive, is the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>spirituall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> whereby spirituall good things are <hi>communicated</hi> to those that are so engrafted and received into communion. This is the conceived sense, by <hi>Beza, Paraeus, Piscator,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>frame of the Text</hi> forceth as much; for <hi>this fatnesse cannot</hi> be the efficacy of <hi>saving grace,</hi> or spirituall dispositions issuing from the Covenant of grace; for <hi>this fatnesse</hi> is communicated <hi>from the Olive,</hi> but so saving grace is not conveyed from the Church to her Members: <hi>This fatnesse</hi> may be <hi>lost,</hi> for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111062:205"/> branches may be broken off, and so severed from the Olive, and so from all the juice and moisture that comes therefrom; but none can lose this saving grace, he shall at any time be made partaker of: once engrafted into Christ, never severed from him. The words opened, the Argument proceeds thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They who are not engrafted into the Olive, the true Church, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not share in the fatnesse of the Olive, the Priviledges of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But children of Parents non-confederate, are not engrafted into the Olive, the Church:</hi> for their engrafting comes not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but from their next Parents, who are not entred into Church-covenant.</p>
                     <p>Nor will <hi>that conceit</hi> come in place of <hi>answer,</hi> that <hi>the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parent is enough for the engrafting of themselves and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity:</hi> For</p>
                     <p>That engrafting or admission into the Church, is here meant, which excommunication out of the Church can take away; for that which the Church gives, that the Church can take away.</p>
                     <p>But profession of the truth excommunication cannot take away, as sense and experience evidenceth. Therefore that is not the engrafting here meant.</p>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That they must be dispensed publikely, in the presence, and with the concurrence of the Church solemnly assembled:</hi> for since the <hi>seals of the Covenant, and the preaching of the Covenant goe together:</hi> the publication of the one must accompany the dispensation of the other; it is not in the power of the Church to confine preaching into corners, for <hi>wisdom cryeth openly in the streets,</hi> Prov. 8.2, 3. and <hi>of old</hi> the Church of the Jewes erected <hi>Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues in every City</hi> (beside the Temple set up in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) for the hearing and preaching of the Word: our Saviour enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Disciples, <hi>what they heard in the ear secretly, to preach open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the house top,</hi> Matth. 10.27. John 18.20, 21, 22. And he compares the Supper of the Lord to their ordinary supper; so he opposeth manifestly the <hi>Church or Congregation</hi> to the <hi>private house,</hi> and declareth, that the Lords Supper should be celebrated in the Congregation, as the Banquet should be kept in their private houses, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the scope and nature of the Ordinance cals for such an Administration; for since the Sacraments are badges to shew our separation from all other prophane societies, and to signifie our communion one with another visibly in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and confession of the faith, as our spirituall union and communion with Christ our head mystically; therefore the administration of them should be such as should suit the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111062:206"/> of the Ordinance, and serve the end of it: and therefore it is, that in times of persecution, when the Church dare not, nor is it meet she should shew her self to the enemy; yet not then, is the Word of God nor Sacraments privately preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or administred, neither yet ought to be; for though they be done in the house of a private man, yet because they are and ought to be administred in <hi>the presence of the Congregation,</hi> there is neither private preaching, nor private celebrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>that both these Ordinances should goe hand in hand, after the word opened the seals should be administred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Baptist,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Disciples,</hi> are precedentiall to us in this behalf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2, 3. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 5. for this last <hi>verse</hi> refers unto the former (the description of <hi>Iohn</hi> his person and behaviour being put in occasionally) when <hi>Iohn</hi> came <hi>preaching in the Wildernesse, Repent for the Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> THEN <hi>come to him the people from all coasts</hi> and were baptized. And hence he is said <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>to baptize in the Wildernesse and to preach the Baptisme of repentance,</hi> because there was a concurrence; the one made way for the more cleer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and the effectuall working, and fruitfull enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the other.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>that collection</hi> seemes to be faire, which is observed by some Interpreters (who comonly search more norrowly unto the text) <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4. <hi>Paul</hi> meaning to conferre the gifts of the holy Ghost, which the twelve Disciples at <hi>Ephesus</hi> were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the putting on of hands, unto the performance of the truth, by the performance of the promise figured by Baptisme, and <hi>so to joyn the signe with the thing signified.</hi> In the fourth verse he sheweth <hi>how Iohn preached and administred that ordinance; first</hi> he preached that his Disciples should beleeve in Jesus Christ, which came after him: after in the fourth, that <hi>those Disciples of Iohn</hi> (and not as is commonly supposed, those twelve Disciples of <hi>Ephesus) having heard Iohns preaching</hi> (and not as is supposed <hi>Pauls) were baptized into the name of the Lord Iesus:</hi> this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation hath plaine proof from the Grammar of the words, the two <hi>Conjunctions</hi> (which have relation one to the other, and cannot without force be severed) lead the Reader to this way, and lay forth the <hi>order of the administration,</hi> that <hi>after they had heard Iohn Baptist preach, they were baptized.</hi> THIS MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111062:207"/> OF ADMINISTRATION OF SACRAMENTS IS COMMON <hi>to both of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is something that is PECULIAR TO EACH, to which we shall adde one word.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Baptisme is the Sacrament of our Initiation and ingrafting into Christ;</hi> and that is the usuall phrase of the Gospel, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. our insition and incorporation into Christ, is fignified and sealed up by Baptisme: and hence Baptisme is <hi>once administred,</hi> and never again to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because of the stability of the covenant of Grace: It is an everlasting Covenant, and they are the sure mercies that are there sealed up; the constancy of God's truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards his, notwithstanding all their failing and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which overbear them in their daily course; <hi>whom Christ loves once, he loves to the end: his gifts and calling are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> and therefore whom he cals effectually, he <hi>preserves</hi> for ever <hi>through faith unto salvation;</hi> that <hi>no man shall,</hi> and therefore they cannot, <hi>take,</hi> themselves out of his hand, unlesse they be more then men: no falling away then totally or finally from the Covenant, and therefore no repeating of Baptisme, which seals up our entrance into the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>That which occasions some kind of further consideration here, is that which hath been a little stirring of late, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether Baptisme is to be administred by pouring of water, and so washing the body therewith, or by dipping the body into the water?</hi> for herein lyes the very hit and turn of the question, as it is now controverted: for</p>
                     <p>First, it is confessed of every side, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> signifies to <hi>Dip:</hi> we say to Dip, for so it is sometime used by the seventy: Ruth 2.14. <hi>Ruth dippeth her Bread into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> 1 Sam 14.27. <hi>Ionathan dipped the end of his rod into the honey-comb:</hi> Thus it signifies to <hi>Dip,</hi> but seldome or never to <hi>Dive,</hi> as learned <hi>Beza</hi> interprets and explicates the propriety of the word, when he intends to lay forth the limits of it in its own bounds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in ordinary course it is commonly used among Authors, and in Scripture, for <hi>to Wash, Luke</hi> 11.38. the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees wondred at our Saviour, that he did not <hi>Wash before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>, so <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.4, 8.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:111062:207"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>washing</hi> is the <hi>main thing intended by our Saviour in the institution,</hi> and to be attended in the signification of the use of the water in the Sacrament of Baptisme: and this is evidenced by these testimonies, which speak expresly to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. points at this, by speciall descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be the <hi>intended singnification of the outward sign, unto which Baptisme, now answering, saves us.</hi> But the question might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily arise, what of Baptisme is here meant? for there be two things in the Sacrament; the <hi>outward signe,</hi> and the spirituall part, <hi>the thing signified.</hi> The Apostle therfore by way of preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by a speciall description, distinctly interprets himself; I mean <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,</hi> i. e. <hi>the washing of water,</hi> which is the signification to be attended in the use of the outward signe, and is the outward part of the Sacrament; but I mean the inward and spirituall part. To this agrees that <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. God is said to <hi>save us by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> which is said to be <hi>poured out upon us;</hi> following the resemblance of <hi>water poured, in the washing of Baptisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor can <hi>that phrase</hi> rationally admit another construction, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. when our Saviour promiseth his Disciples they should <hi>be baptized with the holy Ghost not many dayes after,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized with water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As they were baptized by the spirit, so they were baptized with water,</hi> for so the proportion requires; and therefore it is an utter <hi>mistake</hi> to think that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> implies the <hi>dipping into the water,</hi> when the proposition [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>] as most frequently with the Hebrewes, and generally amongst all <hi>Gramarians,</hi> notes onely the <hi>cause</hi> or <hi>instrument,</hi> and so it carries <hi>causa</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> with it; to baptize in water as a means used to signifie and seal up the Covenant; and therefore the like is used, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap>; <hi>not</hi> that we are <hi>dipped into</hi> the holy Ghost, but that the holy Ghost is <hi>poured upon us,</hi> and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it by the <hi>shedding and pouring out of the holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 2.33. and therefore I could wish that these particulars might be considered.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>As we are baptized by the Spirit,</hi> so by proportion we are said to be <hi>baptized with water,</hi> so the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But we are baptized by the Spirit, when that is applied to us first;</hi> as the practice expounds the promise, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. with <hi>chap.</hi> 2.33.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:111062:208"/>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the nature of Baptisme, and the administration thereof, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers the work of application;</hi> because it is to seal and confirm the Covenant to us: As it is agreed, so communicated and sealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the applying the water to the body firstly, answers the work of application:</hi> for Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y his Spirit doth apply himself to us first, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>we apprehend as we are comprehend:</hi> the promise comes to us before we can come to it.</p>
                     <p>Nay, the Argument growes yet stronger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which crosseth the nature of the Covenant, that administration of the Seal suits it not; but Immersion intimateth, that we apply our selves first to Christ, and so to the Covenant, and this crosseth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the covenant; and therefore this administration suits it not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which best resembleth our implanting into the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the death and resurrection of Christ: That administration fits the nature of Baptisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the applying and casting the water upon the body best resembles the nature of Buriall,</hi> as sense will suggest: the dipping of the body into the dust, doth no way so lively remsemble Burial, as the casting dust and mold upon it.</p>
                     <p>THE MANNER OF ADMINISTRATION PECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAR TO THE SUPPER, is in two things.</p>
                     <p>First, it is a Sacrament of our nourishment, and our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the Lord Jesus, and therefore it is appointed by him to be frequently used, as being one of the standing dishes which the Lord Christ hath provided for the daily diet and the houshold provision of his faithfull ones, who are his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, 1 Cor. 11.26, 34. <hi>as often as ye eat this bread, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this purpose, our Saviour is here presented to us, as the spirituall food; nay, as the choice and compleat feast of the soul, such as may answer all our wants, and our desires also: <hi>Bread</hi> sustains the <hi>hungry, Wine</hi> refreshes the <hi>thirsty, both satisfie to the full:</hi> Christ <hi>saves perfectly all that come unto him,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
                     <p>And hence secondly, in the <hi>admistration,</hi> as there be <hi>distinct parts</hi> of the Ordinance, so there is a <hi>distinct blessing,</hi> which was expressed by our Saviour in the first institution, and is to be imitated by all his Officers: For the words are open; <hi>He took Bread and blessed it; after the same manner be took the Cup, and blessed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111062:208"/> it also:</hi> For one action is expressed, and the rest are implied, the very frame of the words, and order in which they are set forth, imply as much.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>blessing of the Bread commeth immediately after the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it apart: Hence that blessing came before the taking of the Wine, and setting that apart for that spirituall end,</hi> and therefore before the blessing of that Element; and therefore <hi>there must be a distinct benediction used from the former:</hi> and that best suits with the distinct nature of the severall Elements which are appointed by our Saviour, and are to be used and received by the Communicants in that distinct consideration: for though whole <hi>Christ spiritally</hi> be in each part of the Supper, it is not a piece of Christ, as Bread and Food represented to the Receiver; yet there is <hi>not all Christ Sacramentally, but in both.</hi>

               <p>THe Lord Christ being a tender hearted father to his Church, as his family and houshold, he hath not onely provided wholsome and choice diet, his holy and spirituall Ordinances for the food and refreshing of the souls of his faithfull, that so they may grow up into him in all things, and encrease with the encreasings of God.</p>
               <p>But he hath laid in <hi>Purgatives</hi> as well as <hi>Restoratives;</hi> and out of his infinite wisdoms, who knows, to how many corrupt distempers, as so many hurtfull and noisesome diseases the Saints are subject unto: he hath appointed <hi>Church-censures</hi> as good Physick, to purge out what is evill, as well as Word and Sacraments, which, like good diet, are sufficient to nourish the soul to eternal life.</p>
               <p>And his earning compassion hath made him here so careful, that he hath appointed <hi>each particular Brother,</hi> as a skilfull Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, to help forward the spirituall health of all in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The <hi>proceeding in the dispensation of censures is double,</hi> according to the double quality of offenders and offences,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Private offences</hi> appear only to few, one or more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they onely are to proceed against them, in <hi>covering</hi> and <hi>biding</hi> them from the apprehensions of others, as much as may be; provided, they can thereby attain an healing of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>rules</hi> here to rectifie their proceeding, that they may not neglect their duty, in not endeavouring reformation, or else through unskilfulnesse encrease sin and trouble, when they would remove the one and prevent the other.</p>
               <p>The RULES I say, to regulate <hi>their proceedings by,</hi> are these:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>such humain infirmities,</hi> which unavoidably attend the best Saints breathing upon earth, while they carry a body of death about them, are not to be taken as matter of offence intended by our Saviour, nor have we any just cause to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at such straws, or be taken with distaste against the carriage of a Brother in that case; and therefore they come not under the nature of an offence in this advice of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If the sin be such,</hi> which is like a <hi>stone of stumbling in our Christian course,</hi> and therefore needs to be reformed in <hi>him that commits,</hi> and to be removed out of <hi>the way of him that sees it,</hi> we must here attend our duty, and the direction of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, but if yet it be not <hi>so cleer, but doubtfull</hi> to us onely, though our thoughts and apprehensions lead that way; it is not yet ripe for any Church processe. But if fears and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pursue us, as fearing we do not what we should, for the good of our Brother, nor for the setling of our affections to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111062:209"/> him: we may enquire by way of doubt, to be satisfied, and to have our hearts quieted, but not adventure to censure it: for it is a safe rule, <hi>Where we have not found ground of conviction, we have no reason to administer an Admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the offence be such, which deserves a censure, and that we have evidence enough of Argument and rule to convince to our apprehension, it is yet the fairest way <hi>to enter into a serious debate and consideration of the evil, and to hear fully and freely what can be said by the offending party, for his defence:</hi> The grounds which are good to bear an admonition, will then be more cleer, all shifts by discourse being fully discovered, we may better see how more fully and undeniably to fasten a convicting reproof upon a Brother, which is that our Saviour counsels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>. If this fear and warinesse were well attended, those ordinary mistakes, clashings, sayings and gainsayings, and the many offences committed amongst Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, while they come to reform one offence given, would easily be prevented through the help and assistance of Christ, if the party that comes to rebuke, would be sure,
<list>
                     <item>First, that <hi>the sin was committed.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, that he hath <hi>evidence,</hi> either by the <hi>confession</hi> of the party, or <hi>witnesse of others,</hi> that such a Brother committed it.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, that such a <hi>rule</hi> is fair and <hi>full to convince of such a sinne.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The majesty of Christs Ordinance would appear with much evidence, and with much ease and comfort on all hands, in all the degrees of it; whether it be between thee and him, or whether in case of not hearing, you take one or two; or if need require, in bringing it to the Church. <hi>Thus of private Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the <hi>offence be</hi> FAMOUS AND NOTORIOUS AT THE FIRST PRACTICE OF IT, as open drunkennesse, swearing, stealing, lying; or that a Brother, according to the rule of Christ, by reason of anothers <hi>obstinacy,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to tell it to the Church, and make it publike.</p>
               <p>In this PUBLIKE PROCESSE two things are to be attended:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The preparation to the sentence.</hi>
                     </item>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:111062:210"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By way of <hi>Preparation,</hi> the offence must,</p>
               <p>First, be <hi>brought to the Elders,</hi> and by them debated and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Church; for they are <hi>guides and leaders of the Church,</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>the watchmen and overseers of it,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must know the causes and controversies to the full in all circumstances, difficulties, windings and turnings thereof, that they may be able to lead the Congregation in the wayes of peace and truth; which they cannot do, unlesse they know the way the way themselves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to them it appertains <hi>to judge whether the things be of weight and worth,</hi> and so need and require the presence and assistance of the body to expresse their judgment against them, and the party guilty of them or no: for if they be petty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and altogether unfit and unworthy to trouble the Congregation withall: it is in their power to prevent such causlesse and needlesse disturbance, and therefore to suppresse any further proceeding therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It will be said happly, By this means, and under this pretence, if the Elders be corrupt in their judgement, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in their affections, they may silence the weightiest cause that can be, and so prejudice the innocency of those, they are not friendly affected unto, and hinder the reformation of those, whom in a corrupt and partiall way they sinfully fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Therefore as it is in their power to suppresse such petty occasions which are not worthy the time, pains and disturbance that must be spent upon them; so yet to prevent in justice and partiality in such cases, the party who takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wronged, <hi>may complain of the Elders</hi> in that behalf: And if <hi>the Congregation</hi> see apparently, they have dealt unjustly and partially, <hi>it is in their power to rectifie it:</hi> but if the complaint prove unjust and unreasonable, be it at the perill of him that complains, for he is to be censured sharply and severely, as out of pride and perversnesse, refusing to listen to the season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advice and counsell of those who were set over him by the Lord: as also, because he hath needlesly disturbed the peace of the Congregation as much as in him lieth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this preparation is to be made by the Elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the body of the people,</hi> if numerous, they will be unable with any comely conveniency, to <hi>consider</hi> and weigh <hi>all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111062:210"/> with all the emerging difficulties,</hi> which will certainly and necessarily occurre in such agitations: nor can in reason bestow their time and pains upon them, as the intricacy and perplexity of the work will sometimes require.</p>
               <p>But when all things are cleered, the native and naked state of the controversie laid forth and presented in the severals of it, even <hi>the meanest in the Congregation</hi> will generally be able to see cause to joyn their judgments with the truth.</p>
               <p>This <hi>preparation</hi> of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lyes in two things: the
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Cause must be examined presently.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Examination recorded exactly.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>the examination of controversies</hi> (because the eagernesse of some spirits is inordinate in the pursuit of an offence too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly; and the pride of all mens hearts generally is such, that though they can do shamefully, yet they are loth to bear the shame of it; and therefore out of their waywardnesse wilinesse of heart, are ready to wimble and winde out devices, that they may put by the dint of a discovering and convicting Argument.) HE THAT COMPLAINS MUST KNOW TWO RULES.</p>
               <p>First, that he must not dare to complain to the Elder of a Church, <hi>unlesse he can plainly and peremptorily lay in his accusation of another, touching</hi> such speeches and carriages, of which upon through search, he is well assured: I say, <hi>peremptorily accuse</hi> of things whereof he is groundedly assured, because I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such weak and windy kind of expressions, as too often we meet withall, out of mens too sudden pangs and heedlesse mistakes. <hi>I take it so; I conceived it so; it was so reported; I met with it on that manner, &amp;c.</hi> when upon the search, all these vanish as mistakes: The <hi>word</hi> is, we <hi>must rebuke convictingly,</hi> Mat. 18.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as his accusation must be plain, <hi>so his proofs must be direct and pregnant,</hi> that such words, for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and reality of them were spoken, and such things done; there must be <hi>two witnesses to establish every word,</hi> except the things be otherwayes evidenced sufficiently, as by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the party, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On <hi>the</hi> ELDERS PARTS TWO RULES, if attended, make a great riddance, of occasions, and prevent distemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>rs.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>let the accusation be presently and exactly recorded,</hi> tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111062:211"/> with the <hi>answer</hi> thereunto in like manner: for experience teacheth, that in multiplicity of debates, parties are apt to forget, or else not willing to remember, and sometimes ready to mistake, adde, alter, vary in expressions, as they see there may any advantage come to their own, or disadvantage to the contrary cause: All again by this means is easily prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the truth made open to the apprehension of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>let the Elders confine all parties to the poynt in hand,</hi> and not suffer them by extravagancies to darken the truth, disturb the proceedings, and bring confusion to the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. They are also, by their authority put into their hands, <hi>to forbid and restrain all personall and passionate expressions,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain both sides to speak to the cause, and onely to the cause in hand.</p>
               <p>Thus the preparation is done, the cause rightly stated and cleered, doubts answered, mistakes removed, and by proofs fair and sufficient, the truth confirmed; now the cause is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ripe for judgement, and may easily be determined in half an hour, which cost many weeks in the search and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof.</p>
               <p>The EXECUTION of the sentence issues in four things.</p>
               <p>First, the <hi>cause</hi> exactly recorded, is as <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>nakedly</hi> to be <hi>presented to the</hi> consideration of <hi>the Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Elders</hi> are to goe before the Congregation in <hi>laying open the rule,</hi> so far as reacheth any particular now to be considered, and to <hi>expresse their judgement</hi> and <hi>determination</hi> thereof, <hi>so far as appertains to themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, unlesse the people be able to convince them of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and mistakes in their sentence, they are <hi>bound to joyn their judgement with theirs, to the compleating of the sentence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the sentence,</hi> thus compleatly issued, is to be <hi>solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passed and pronounced</hi> upon the Delinquent <hi>by the ruling Elder,</hi> whether it be the censure of <hi>admonition</hi> or <hi>excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Touching this last, Of <hi>EXCOMM∆≤NICATION.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>There be <hi>several cases</hi> which offer themselves to further search
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111062:211"/> and consideration, of which we may briefly, and in order en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, having an eye and reference to what hath been said touching the first <hi>subject of the keyes, where</hi> all these disputes had their <hi>first rise,</hi> and shall receive <hi>their last resolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Question is, <hi>What is the order of the Gospel in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of this great and dreadfull Ordinance of Excommunication?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, the <hi>execution</hi> of this sentence against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, against whom it is passed, concerns all the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all bound to reject all Church-communion with him, and that because he hath renounced the rule of Christ, and is therefore justly <hi>delivered up to Satan, to be his slave in the kingdom of darknesse, who would not be a subject to Christ in the kingdom of light:</hi> they are to renounce all <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary familiarity with him, even in civill converse,</hi> that they may, as much as in them lyes, <hi>without any breach of any bond or relation that lyes upon them,</hi> discountenance him in his course, <hi>and cause him to be ashamed;</hi> and therefore in some particulars he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the degree of a Heathen: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>with such a one eat not;</hi> and yet 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. <hi>if an Infidel invite to a feast,</hi> we may goe by allowance from the Apostle; and by parity of reason, we may invite such occasionally: but the like carriage we may not expresse to an Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now because the execution of the sentence concerns all, therefore it were to be wished, there should be an unanimous consent of all unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>hence excommunication</hi> being an Ordinance of so great terrour, and of so common and great concernment unto all, (if we look at the <hi>manner</hi>) it must be proceeded in with much <hi>moderation, pitty, patience and long-sufferance:</hi> if there can be a healing of a corrupt member, we must not <hi>be hasty to cut it off:</hi> If we look <hi>at the matter,</hi> it must <hi>not</hi> be for <hi>petty and small aberrations,</hi> but for <hi>such evils as the mind and conscience of a man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the truth of God, would condemn in himself or any, upon the first serious consideration,</hi> was his understanding left to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reason, to act thereby, and not crack-brained and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with prejudice and selfishnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, such evils which are either hainous and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as <hi>fornication, murder, adultery, incest, treason, &amp;c.</hi> or if not so grosse, yet <hi>carry the face of evill in their forehead, upon the first serious and wel-grounded consideration of reason;</hi> and have been <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously and obstinately persisted in,</hi> after the improvement of all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111062:212"/> means upon them for conviction and reformation: <hi>these onely deserve excommunication</hi> by the rules of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when such evils are presented to the Church, and there is a <hi>mutuall and joynt concurrence of all;</hi> every particular Congregation hath received power from Christ to proceed to excommunication without any more ado.</p>
               <p>This every one grants, may be done by a Church in an Island; and every particular Congregation hath as much power and right in that censure (as formerly hath been touched, and shall more fully be proved afterward:) the like also may be done <hi>if some few should dissent,</hi> in case their reasons be heard and answered, and they silenced by the power of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, but in <hi>case</hi> things prove <hi>doubtfull</hi> (which rarely they will, or can in truth, if rules formerly mentioned be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and <hi>the difference grow wide and great, it is then seasonable to crave the counsell and help of neighbouring Churches;</hi> not to receive any power from them to execute the censure: but that they may see the truth cleered, the erring parties may be convinced, the way also warranted; <hi>which being done, either all will agree, or else the major part of the Church hath power and right to proceed and passe the censure according unto Christ; and the rest of the Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, are bound to sit down satisfied therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>in case the counsell of the consociated Churches shall advise to with-hold;</hi> the case will then appear doubtful, and want ground of conviction of the Churches part; and therefore they will want ground of execution, as hath been said; and therefore <hi>they must stay their proceeding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second question is, <hi>Where lyes the</hi> HIGHEST TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUNALL <hi>where this sentence issues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Before we can lay forth the rule of proceeding in this censure, and the order and rank that each person must keep, according to his power and place: we shall speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, first, by way of <hi>explication of the nature of the censure;</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, lay forth the <hi>bounds according unto which the people</hi> should confine themselves in putting forth their power: lastly, give <hi>in the reasons</hi> shortly of the question so stated.</p>
               <p>First, this censure of excommunication, and the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that makes way for it, is to be attƒìded in a double regard,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111062:212"/> either as it is
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Legally prepared.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Dogmatically propounded</hi> by the Elders, as leaders to the Congregation: or</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Judicially passed and executed.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the understanding of the first, you must recall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it appertained to the <hi>place and office of the Rulers,</hi> by through search and examination, to ripen the cause, and to cleer all mistakes, and settle the truth by sufficient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable witnesse; and therefore in case things were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and admit no serious or through proof, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should not be troubled with such things: where no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction can be gained, there no censure of publike admonition or excommunication should be administred. But when things are fully testified, then they are dogmatically to discover the mind of God, and the rule of Christ, according to which a Congregation should proceed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their judgements thus expressed, the compasse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the people should confine themselves in putting forth <hi>their power and judgement,</hi> may be conceived in THIS RULE.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fraternity have no more power to oppose the sentence of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, thus prepared and propounded by the Elders, then they have to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their dict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ine which they shall publish.</hi> But they have as much power to oppose the one as the other. We will touch both the parts of the <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, they have no more power to oppose the sentence of the censure thus prepared and propounded by the Elders, then they have to oppose their doctrine which they shall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; (let it be here attended, that I speak of the censure as <hi>dogmatically</hi> propounded, not of the <hi>judiciall passing of it,</hi> when it comes to be executed, and then) the proof is plain.</p>
               <p>First, because <hi>they have the same authority in dogmaticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the one, as in promulgation of the other:</hi> They are acts, which alike issue out of their office, in which they are placed, and unto which they are called of God, and bound to be leaders to the people, as in preparing the cause, that it may be ripe and ready for the censure, so in laying open the rule, as it reacheth the severall particulars, and to expresse their judgement and determination thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that their power is equall in both, appears pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111062:213"/> thus: when the cause is cleered and proved by evidence of undeniable witnesses, <hi>the Elder may refer it to the Word, and out of the word preach it as a Doctrine:</hi> so that the sentence the Elder will passe, shall be a point he will preach; and therefore none shall oppose the one, but he shall oppose the other.</p>
               <p>And <hi>hence</hi> it follows, which was formerly intimated, that if the people cannot convince the Elder of his errour or mistake in the sentence, <hi>they are bound to joyn their judgement with his in the compleating of the sentence,</hi> without impertinent questions, needlesse scruples, wilfull and disorderly gainsayings; for if they cannot confute his Doctrine, they are bound to entertain and establish it.</p>
               <p>Therefore they must do so with their censures, as the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence forceth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this kind of proceeding in judicature discovers so much wisdom, care and faithfulnesse of the Lord Christ, in providing for the comfort, honour and safety of his Church, as the like is not to be found in all the governments upon earth, wherein the greatest excellency ever appeared to the appehension of the sons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For behold the Lord Christ is so tender and compassionate over his Church, that the meanest member thereof shall not be touched in the least measure in his liberty, but he hath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, called and appointed his Officers, wise and holy watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that shall secretly and seriously examine all things with all exactnesse, shall receive nothing but upon such proof, as that whereby every word shall be established; and yet when all this is evidenced, they shall not proceed against them in private, but they shall present all these evidencs to the view and consideration of them all; lay open the rule of truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and nothing shall be done that they shall oppose, but must approve and set their hand and seal unto, as suitable to the rules of truth, and righteousnesse, and love. And this proceeding is held in all things to all his members: the like is not to be found on earth.</p>
               <p>The second part of the Conclusion is, <hi>That they have as much power and right to oppose their censures, so propounded, as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For their power is alike in dispensing the one, as the other,</hi> as hath been proved: and therefore <hi>if they can oppose the one, they may so far oppose the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then it is yeelded on all hands, <hi>that the fraternity may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111062:213"/> renounce and condemn the false, erronious and hereticall Doctrines of an Elder,</hi> and hinder them that they may never be entertained nor established in the place, <hi>yea reject his opinions, and take away his Office from him:</hi> they may do <hi>as much</hi> by parity of reason <hi>against his false and unjust censures</hi> propounded and concluded, and so interpose and oppose proceeding, as that they shall never take place and be established in the Congregation, onely the method and order prescribed before in case of difference, must be attended.</p>
               <p>The conclusion then is, The <hi>fraternity</hi> put for tha <hi>causall power</hi> in the censure of exc≈çmunication, whence it receives its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat being, <hi>and here lyes the supream Tribunal in poynt of judgement,</hi> and publike proceeding in censure against an offender: the reasons of this we have given formerly, when we intreated of the first subject of the keyes, whether we refer the Reader; onely we may recall two or three for the present, that we may not leave this place wholly void.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>that Church that can publikely admonish the Elder or Elders, in case he do not hear one or two, that Church can excommunicate, being not heard,</hi> Mat. 18.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Church of the fraternity, in case the Elders offending will not hear one or two, may also admonish:</hi> For if one or two may admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish privately, according to degrees of processe prescribed by our Saviour, why all may not admonish publikely, I see not, by the same parity and equality of reason.</p>
               <p>If a Brother, <hi>i. e.</hi> any Brother.</p>
               <p>Nay, the case may be such, that they onely will be left to admonish: for suppose three Elders in the Congregation two of them are under offence, in which they do persist, not yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the first or second admonition, to what Church must now the complaint be made; <hi>one Elder is not a Church,</hi> therefore the complaint must be made to the fraternity with him; therefore they must admonish, and therfore may also cast out, if their admonition be not heard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That placing of the supream power, which crosseth the proceeding prescribed by our Saviour, that is not orderly and regular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the placing of the supream power in the Elders doth so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is thus evidenced:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which makes the guilty party the Judge in his own Cause, that crosseth the proceeding prescribed by our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:111062:214"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this doth so:</hi> For in case the Elders offend, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, to whom must the complaint be carried? the text saith, To the Church: the Church (sayes this opinion) is the Elders, and therefore they must be complained unto as their own Judges.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that power which is appointed by Christ in his Church to reform evil</hi> (that being managed according to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in time of peace) <hi>that power can and will attain its end,</hi> otherwise there should be an imputation laid upon our Saviour, that either he wanted wisdome or power in his institutions, in that such were appointed which were not able to attain the end, for which they were provided and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>But if the power of the Censures be placed in the Presbytery, for the removall and purging out of the leven of a pertinacious sinner, it cannot attain his end:</hi> For suppose the body of the people will keep him in, converse with him, and maintain full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, their excommunication will not do the deed, which shewes the arm is too short to manage this power to the full extent of it, as it was intended by our Saviour.</p>
               <p>And hence Master <hi>Ruterford</hi> grants, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 44. That it is the constant received and maintained opinion of Divines, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern, that excommuncation be done, <hi>consentiente plebe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Zepperus, Zanchy, Beza, Bucanus, Paraeus,</hi> think the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership should not excommunicate, <hi>sine consensu.</hi> Nay, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> goes further, <hi>∆≤nde concluditur non absque consensu ecclesiae quempiam excommunicari posse,</hi> loc. com. de excom. sent. 9. <hi>Jus hic ad ecclesiam pertinet, nec ab illa eripi debet,</hi> sent. 10. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. against the Rhemists: <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> Cent. 1. lib. 2. c. 4. <hi>Claves toti ecclesiae sunt traditae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground I conceive of this joynt judgement, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly requiring the consent of the people, doth in truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that <hi>their consent</hi> was not matter of complement, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a causall <hi>vertue</hi> with it, for the compleating and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of this censure.</p>
               <p>And let it be supposed that where there be three Elders, two of them should turn Hereticks and continue so; how could the Church proceed against them, unlesse there was a <hi>causall power in the fraternity</hi> to accomplish this censure?</p>
               <p>For (if by Church was meant the Eldership) how can <hi>one be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111062:214"/> the Church?</hi> and if the people should consent, and yet their consent carry no causall vertue to this work, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is crosse to right reason, remains yet unremoved, <hi>to wit,</hi> that excommunication should proceed and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated <hi>by one man,</hi> which is contrary to the grain of the words, and the processe of our Saviour set down in the place, which is <hi>to rise by encrease from one to two or three, and thence to a multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ground thus proved, being received, many <hi>collections</hi> flow naturally from hence, which will be instead of so many <hi>Answers</hi> to severall <hi>Questions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>the power of judgement</hi> and <hi>power of office</hi> are apparently <hi>distinct</hi> and different <hi>one from another:</hi> The Elders in <hi>poynt of rule</hi> and exercising the act of their Office, are supream, and <hi>above the Congregation;</hi> none have that Office-authority, nor can put forth the acts thereof but themselves: But in <hi>poynt of power of judgement or censure,</hi> the <hi>fraternity</hi> they <hi>are supream,</hi> and above any member or Officer, in case of offence and delinquency: nor need any man strange at this distinction, when the like is daily obvious in paralel examples presented before our eyes.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Major</hi> is above the <hi>Court,</hi> as touching the wayes and works of his Office, none hath right, nor can put forth such acts, which are peculiar to his place, and yet the <hi>Court</hi> is <hi>above in poynt of censure,</hi> and can answerably proceed to punish in a just way, according to the just desert of his sin. Thus the Parliament is above the King, the Souldiers and Captains above their Generall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence</hi> again, <hi>excommunication is not an act of power of Office, but of judgement,</hi> from grounds and grants formerly cleered, and therefore cannot be appropriated to Rulers, nor upon right consideration accounted an act of highest rule, but an act of supream judgement, which is seated in the fraternity, and may be put forth by them in a right order and manner, as it hath been before proved; still that is a staple rule, which stands fast. <hi>The whole hath power over any member and members, and can preserve her self and safety against any of their power that would annoy or destroy it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this must be yeelded by all those who give power of <hi>excommunication to Synods and Councels, in that Brethren as well as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111062:215"/> Elders</hi> are members of the Synods, and the Acts of those As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes issue from <hi>both Elders and Brethren,</hi> as all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox prove against the Popish Impropriators.</p>
               <p>Hence lastly, as long as <hi>the Church</hi> continues, and hath the being of a Church, <hi>she hath right and power</hi> of managing these censures, because it belongs to her <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, and appertains to her as such a body, and therefore cannot be taken away, unlesse her being be taken away: As an Officer, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in his Place and Office, he hath right and power to Preach and administer the Seals, though the exercise of those acts may sometime be hindred by violence and constraint: so while the members continue confederate in combination, and so communion with one another by free consent, they have also power one over another, and in case the part prejudice the whole, it's subject to the power of the whole, to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the communion thereof.</p>

                        <p>
                           <q>But being Members, then its connaturall, they should be subjected to the Eldership of this Congregation; and the ground of the bound is, the part must be in subjection to those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole: <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> are parts of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; such an Eldership commands the whole, <hi>ergo</hi> they must be subject to such an Eldership. <hi>pag. 201.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I do not see how this distinction can clear the cause in hand; for by the same ground I see not why any man may not say that all positive Lawes are naturall, nay cannot be but naturall Lawes; look we at the consequent and condition which may, nay certainly will attend all of them in their very consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                        <p>Take some instance for evidence; when any of the <hi>Heathen</hi> came to imbrace <hi>the Jewes Religion</hi> and ceremoniall Law, they did that by a positive Law, because they might have remained as <hi>Job,</hi> and never become Proselytes.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>when</hi> they are <hi>once</hi> turned Proselytes and become Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Congregation, then it is connaturall that they should submit to all their Ceremonies; every Member of the Corporation must be under the Lawes of the whole; so that by this ground they must be said to obey the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Natures Law; but how harsh doth that sound?</p>
                        <p>Besides, when a man is a Member of such a Congregation, where its ordinary and usuall for such a man to depart at his

                        <p>To end this case, let this reason be attended.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>I propound <hi>these quaeres</hi> to occasion Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explications: But I conceived it necessary to take notice of that <hi>division of a Nation into Provinces, and those into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Territories;</hi> because we have herein the <hi>foundation</hi> laid, and a way made <hi>for Synods,</hi> which must have their garbe and garment cut after this compasse; but it shall anon appeare this Apostolicall pattern will quit us of any such constraining inference.</p>
                        <p>We have now done with the explication and preface to the dispute: We now come to Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> his argument, which he thus propounds out of the place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If the Churches of Antioch being troubled with a question which they could not determine, they had recourse to an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Churches, who gave a Decree, which the Churches
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111062:221"/> were bound to keepe; then, upon like occasion we must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to like remedy.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But the first part is plain; being in this trouble &amp;c. they did resort to an Assembly, which gave out a Decree, which they were bound to keep.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Therefore we also upon the like occasion, must seek for the like remedy, and stoop to the Authority thereof.</q>

                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>whole conclusion</hi> may be <hi>granted</hi> as true in a true sense, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we have formerly opened it in the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions; for its granted, we lawfully may, nay its necessary we should repaire in cases of difficulty and doubt to a Classis or Synode: Its certain they should shew their councell and set down their sentence out of the Word, and lay it by vertue of the Word as a burden upon mens Consciences; and being so published, so confirmed out of the Scriptures, we ought to receive it as the Word, so much as is gathered out of the Word, and attend to it, as an authoritative advice, as Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> speaks, and we have formerly declared in the foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</p>
                        <p>This is all the place inforceth, and all this we grant.</p>
                        <p>But that they did tye Ecclesiastically, by vertue of any Church-jurisdiction, which they had over other Churches, <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum constat,</hi> as yet appeareth not.</p>
                        <p>Act. 15.28. We lay no greater burden. Act. 16.4. And as they went through the Cities, they delivered them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to keepe. Act. 21.25. We have written and concluded, that they observe no such things, but that they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>All this I say, may well agree to a way of councell.</p>
                        <p>For suppose a Christian man out of office (an <hi>exspectant</hi> as Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> speakes) <hi>preach</hi> and publish the Commands of God, he may be said <hi>to presse them as a burden upon mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and charge them as necessary duties,</hi> which they are bound upon the hazard of their soules carefully and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to discharge, and not dare to neglect in the least measure.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>whole frame of the</hi> proceeding, and all the casting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the context shew <hi>that Assembly</hi> acted <hi>by way of councell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. These Decrees are said to bind those to whom they are sent.</p>
                        <p>But they were sent to all the Churches of the Gentiles. Act. 21.25.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As touching the Gentils which beleeve, we have written and concluded &amp;c. who had no</hi> Commissioners nor Messengers dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the Synods; and therefore could not bind them by way of any <hi>authoritative jurisdiction;</hi> For it is a ruled case in all such proceedings synodicall. Those who have warning and liberty to send to the Synode, those are subject to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Synode; what Mr <hi>Parker</hi> expresseth as effectuall to the constitution of a Synode, that is approved by all, and by Mr <hi>Rutherferd; That which materially furnisheth Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at on Assembly in their gifts and holinesse, that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally fits them to that work is their calling and sending. Park. l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Rut.</hi> pag. 213. Where there is no delegation of Messengers by mutuall consent, there is no right of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All these fundamentall grounds which are laid for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly acting of any of their occasions, take this as confessed; for were it enough for severall Churches to assemble and to set out Decrees which might bind all indifferently, whether they had Commissioners or no Commissioners in their meeting; then the Decrees of one Province or Nation might impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Province or Nation, which is by all conceived and concluded to be unequall; nay it may fall out, that they may impose contrary things, and so of necessity breed and bring confusion and vexation in stead of reformation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Decrees of a Synode bind onely such by an Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, who delegate Messengers to the Synode.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the Decrees of this Synode bind more then those who dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Messengers to it; to wit, all the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore, They did not intend to bind by Ecclesiastcall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> but by way <hi>of Christian Councell:</hi> Or more plainly thus,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They who send the Decrees of the Synodo to such Churches,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111062:222"/> who never sent their Messengers or Commissioners thither, they send onely by way of Councell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this Synode at Jerusalem sent their Decrees to all the Churches of the Gentiles, who never sent their Commissioners thither,</hi> erg√≤.</p>

                           <hi>Erg√≤, They sent onely by way of Councell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. That Pattern which sends a Church 200. miles for a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node and consociation, that doth not tye a Church either to a Provinciall or Nationall Synode.</p>
                        <p>But this doth so.</p>
                        <p>If it be replied; If I may go so far, therefore I may gather one nearer.</p>
                        <p>I answer; True, you may do so; but its as true by this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern any delinquent may refuse to do so; but when his cause comes to be scanned, and he to be convented before <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi> or <hi>Nationall Synode,</hi> he may plead that liberty, which the practise of the Apostels propounded here as presidentiall will allow unto them: And so by this Samplar, Nationall and Provinciall Synods are wholly made frustrate, and may as well be rejected as received, notwithstanding any force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the place or practise that might constraine to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>Higher there cannot be then the highest. I speak now only of a way of <hi>Ministeriall</hi> proceeding.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence, the highest and supreme Tribunal cannot be censured by any power of the same kind:</hi> nor yet is there any prejudice to the care and wisdome of our Saviour, <hi>that the punishment of such is reserved onely to the throne of his divine justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That such cannot be censured,</hi> common sense will teach one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Over whom there is no power, upon them can be exercised no cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But the highest Ministeriall power hath no power in that kind above it. (I meane Ecclesiasticall power)</hi> only the supreme Magistrate in the Common-wealth, hath a civill co-active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to constraine the Churches in case of their exhorbitations and Apostasies from the order of the Gospel to attend the rules of Christ, and to recover themselves by a just Reformation.</p>
                  <p>But if we look at the highest Tribunall of Church-power, in case they be faulty, whether can an appeale be made in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall proceeding? To go higher we cannot, because we are at the highest: and to appeale to the <hi>inferiour</hi> from whom the appeale hath been made, not onely the rules of <hi>prudence,</hi> but <hi>common sense</hi> will condemn a man of folly, in such a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor yet doth <hi>this</hi> (in the second place) <hi>derogate any thing from the depth of Christs wisdome and faithfulnesse in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church:</hi> for it is no other, then that which infinite providence doth yeild approbation unto. <hi>When all flesh hath corrupted his way,</hi> and erred in judgement, its but rationall, that then the execution of judgement should come into his hand, who <hi>is the righteous judge of all flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things being premised, which cannot be denyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we will bid battell to common sense, we shall now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our selves to the examination of the seventh and ninth Arguments, because they arise out of one roote, and one bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom serves to beare them both.</p>

                     <p>This is the <hi>maine</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> bottom that bears up <hi>both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> and if this prove brickle, the whole frame will <hi>imis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus ruere;</hi> and that this weakenesse may appeare, I desire no better Armory to fetch weapons from, to wound this cause withall. For <hi>from the ground of this Argument</hi> I would <hi>reason thus,</hi> not that I take the ground good, but <hi>its good against him and his cause, because it is his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If when an obstinate Brother offends I must tell the Church, then when an obstinate Church offends, I must take the same course: then when an Oecumenicall Synod or Councell offends, I must take the same course: but that is exceeding irrationall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Christs remedy of <hi>excommunication</hi> must remove <hi>all</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>else its imperfect.</hi> But <hi>excommunication cannot remove the offences of an Oecumenicall Councell; therefore Christs remedy is imperfect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that it cannot remove the offence of a general Councell, reason and common sense doth evidence at the first sight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the conclusions formerly proved; for to whom can the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale be made, or who can excommunicate?</p>
                     <p>When Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath answered these Arguments, he will answer himselfe.</p>

                        <p>For suppose I am a Delinquent, the Classis will proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                        <p>The party that broacheth false Doctrine in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not convinced, cannot be reclaimed from his errour by the Classis, but makes an appeale from them to an higher Court of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which may right his wrong; but that shall not be a <hi>Provinciall</hi> nor <hi>Nationall Synode in</hi> Scotland, <hi>but one in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>or</hi> Holland, and from this pattern he pleads his lawfull liberty in such a proceeding.</p>

                        <p>To this head belongs that which he addes in the 221 pag. as arising from the like mistake.</p>

                        <p>To which I reply, 1. From that which hath been said it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that <hi>all rebuking is not an act of the power</hi> of the Keyes: and therefore that may be used, when excommunication can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
                        <p>Beside, it hath not onely been affirmed but proved, there can be no act of excommunication passe upon <hi>some Churches,</hi> as I suppose will be granted by them: and it shall Christ helping be made evident, that it can passe upon none in propriety of speech, or acording to the order of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, that <hi>rebuking</hi> out of <hi>Christian charity</hi> is diverse from an act of <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>excommunication:</hi> I suppose there need no better proofe then his own principles will yeild.</p>

                        <p n="3">3.

                        <p>I reply: Something is here craved, which hath been proved to be farre from truth, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the <hi>consociating of Churches is to make a Presbyteriall or Synodicall Church:</hi> and to make the particular congregations <hi>members</hi> of the Church, <hi>as an integrum</hi> which is not so, but a meere <hi>concurrence</hi> and <hi>combining</hi> of their <hi>councels</hi> together, without any <hi>authoritative and Church juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> over the particulars.</p>
                        <p>And this he perceived to follow by undenyable Argument, that the <hi>renouncing the right hand of fellowship,</hi> which other Churches may do, and should do as occasion requires, is <hi>another thing from excommunication.</hi>

                        <p>I Reply. <hi>These severall places</hi> have commonly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beeen propounded and alledged many times, in many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the book, <hi>they have met us, as it were, at every turne,</hi> and stopped us in our way: In all which we have referred the full debate and disquisition about them, <hi>unto this, as the proper place.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore we shall take leave a little more seriously, <hi>to examine the particulars</hi> once for all: that so it may appeare, what vigor and validity is in all these instances to conclude the cause in hand, and whether there is a sufficient cause to place so great confidence in the severall practices here expressed.</p>
                        <p>Onely before we can apply our selves to the particulars, that must here be remembred and taken along with us, which will easily be yeilded and confessed on all hands.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The office of the Apostles, being extraordinary, as</hi> having the care of all the Churches under their care and watch, they did, as extraordinary persons, interpose their power in all the particular Churches, where ever they came: as also expresse their judgements by vote and counsell, as occasion did require.</p>
                        <p>And therefore what they did in this case, it must not, it <hi>should not be drawn into example: extraordinary practices,</hi> are <hi>no</hi> sutable ingredients to make up <hi>ordinary precedents, as certaine</hi> and standing copies to succeeding generations. But we must take onely that which is ordinary, when we would make ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary patterns to regulate our proceedings by.</p>
                        <p>This being <hi>once mentioned and remembred,</hi> it will ease us of needlesse repetitions in the succeeding discourse.</p>
                        <p>I reply then, First <hi>generally.</hi> Secondly we shall <hi>examine</hi> short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>particulars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Generally.</hi> That there <hi>can be no warrant or proofe of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in these severall instances,</hi> It will appeare by apparant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences from Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>owne principles;</hi> who pag. 204. layes this down as a confessed truth, which admits no dispute.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>That the members of a Synod, must be Elders and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, sent as Commissioners from severall Churches, <hi>which are not here to be found in any of these places.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:111062:228"/>2. <q>The ground of thus gathering members from many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it must be matter of weight, and that which is attended with much difficulty and danger also.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <q>The manner of their proceeding, is by way of disquisition and agitation of all or many of the members, who are willing to speake.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <q>The decisions and determinations are by common consent, and joynt approbation of all, in whose name such sentences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and published.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>none of all</hi> these are to be found <hi>in any of these instances:</hi> so that to my shallow conceiving, there is not the least sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Synod.</p>
                        <q>But secondly, let us come some what neerer, and take the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> into speciall consideration.</q>
                        <p>In <hi>Act.</hi> 1. There be these three things to be attended, which take up the substance of the whole proceeding.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Peter</hi> leades the action, layes forth the ground of their meeting, and the mind of God, how the action should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, ver. 15. to 23.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The whole Assembly, by mutuall consent, present two to choice.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And commend the determination of the businesse to God by prayer, and so cast lots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>What is here</hi> done, that carryes the face <hi>or appearance of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>True: the eleven Apostles <hi>were here together,</hi> because they were injoyned by our Saviour, to abide in <hi>Jerualem,</hi> untill they were indued with the spirit from above. But there is nothing here done, but <hi>any one</hi> might have done it; nor was there need to crave the concurrence of other Churches which they had not. The whole Church concurred, by mutuall consent to appoint two to lot: and accepted him, upon whom the lot fell. Here was no joynt voyces and suffrages of Pastors and select Brethren of many Congregations, which was the thing to be proved. Nor can I imagine where the force of the dispute lies, or whence it will be fetched.</p>
                        <p>If Peter directed the particular Assembly, how farre they should go, and after what manner they should proceed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for the choice of <hi>Matthias;</hi> then Synods have Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Authority over particular Congregations.</p>
                        <p>How crasy is such a consequence.</p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:111062:228"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And yet the second instance</hi> carries a <hi>further distance</hi> from the cause in hand, and is marvellous wide from the marke: For all that is expressed, or can be gathered from <hi>Act.</hi> 4.35. That the Apostles had the <hi>disposing of the common treasury and provision,</hi> which men raised by the selling of their goods, and laid it at their feet, to dispense as seemed fittest to their wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: All which its certain they did as <hi>extraordinary persons,</hi> and that in an extraordinary manner; the Officers which were to take care of such occasions, <hi>not</hi> being <hi>yet</hi> appointed in the Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Where are the joynt voices</hi> and suffrages of Apostles, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and select Brethren of <hi>many Congregations,</hi> which were to be demonstrated by promise to be in this Example? Beside, <hi>how Deacons</hi> are to order the treasury of the Church, needs <hi>no Synod</hi> at all, if we would consider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without the extraordinary managing of it, to reason then from this place,</p>
                        <p>If the Apostles by the extraordinary power of their places did manage the treasury of the Church, because the Office of Deacons was not yet instituted; Then a Synod hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Ecclesiastick Power over a Congregation.</p>
                        <p>Such an inference hath little cement of reason.</p>
                        <p>Neither doth <hi>the third instance</hi> comes near the Conclusion to be proved, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. touching the <hi>ordination of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;</hi> For <hi>where are the joynt voices</hi> and suffrages of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Elders, and select Brethren of <hi>many Congregations,</hi> which was the proposition to be confirmed? Its true the people are directed to make choice of able men, and that <hi>any Congregation</hi> in particular may do, nay it hath right to do, without a Synod. The <hi>Apostles as extraordinary men, they laid on their hands</hi> for the establishment of them in their places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary persons, and having a plenitude of power in them: But to inferre hence,</p>
                        <p>If the Apostles laid on their hands upon the Deacons ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the people, therefore a Synod hath authoritative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over a Congregation; such an inference will appear feeble at the first sight.</p>
                        <p>The 11. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and 3. vers. comes next to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111062:229"/> and that hath <hi>as little, if not lesse evidence</hi> of proofe, then any of the former.</p>
                        <p>For there be no joynt voices and suffrages of Pastors and select Brethren of many Congregations, which was the thing to be proved, but it is not so much as remembred, but laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side wholly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is <hi>no evidence</hi> given in, of <hi>many Churches here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> nay no certainty of any; but its most certain they met not (if they met at all) in way of a Synod, or for that end, nor acted, nor intended any thing that way: Onely some of <hi>the Jewes,</hi> who were not so throughly informed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the liberty and lawfulnesse to converse with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> in holy communion as <hi>Peter</hi> had done with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> they questioned his course, and demanded a reason and warrant of his practice: To whom he gave an account, that he might remove all doubts out of their minds and stumbling stones out of the way of the profession, as any Christian man would, and any Apostle ought to remove any appearance of offence that any might take in their way.</p>
                        <p>But hence to reason, If <hi>Peter</hi> gave an account and warrant of his communion with <hi>Cornelius</hi> to those Jewes that questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and was not sufficiently informed therein, be it done before them, or never so many beside them:</p>
                        <p>Then a Synod hath an authoritative Power over a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; there is no conclusive force, nay in truth, nor a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, in such a consequence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That of Act.</hi> 21. carries some <hi>small appearance</hi> at the first view: but when we shall come to nearer search, it will be found to <hi>have little pith in it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its true <hi>Paul</hi> went to visite <hi>James</hi> with whom all the Elders were as it might seeme by some intimation and appointment of <hi>Pauls</hi> coming, that they might entertain him; but <hi>the joynt suffrages</hi> of many Elders and select Brethren, <hi>of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> to determine any businesses, as being called thereunto; there is nor <hi>vola, ne vestigium quidem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Onely the text sayes, <hi>Paul saluted</hi> them, as it may seeme, meeting on purpose to that end, and he reported to them the passages of Gods providence towards him, &amp; the good hand of Gods blessing upon his labour: They also acquainted him, how
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111062:229"/> occasions stood with them, what rumors were spread abroad of him, and what a jealous eye the Jews had touching his disregard of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and suggested such advice as might seeme most advantageous to promote the work of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing here done or recorded, but <hi>what the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a Congregation might do</hi> to some faithfull Minister that was arrived at their coast.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing like calling or carrying on of a Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call work; and without all question, <hi>Synod there was none,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it must be <hi>either Provinciall or Nationall;</hi> and touching either of these, there is not so much as any syllable that sounds this way, in the text: And to reason hence,</p>
                        <p>If <hi>James</hi> and the Elders met to entertaine <hi>Paul</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and he saluted them, and they suggested to him, how he might so carry himselfe in wisedome and warinesse, that he might crush the false rumours that were spread of him; Then a Synod hath Ecclesiasticall Authority over a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There is no constraining force in such a kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That of Acts</hi> 20.28. hath <hi>least of all,</hi> that lookes this way: For the scope of the place, and purpose of the Spirit, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; <hi>Paul</hi> now resolved for <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Spirit of Prophecy knowing that he should never see those coasts, nor their faces, amongst whom he had preached the Gospell; knowing also, that false Teachers as ravening wolves would endeavor to make a prey of them: He therefore desires to take his leave, and solemn farewell of them, and to leave a savoury caution and heart-breaking exhortation, as his last farewell with them, and to that purpose sends for the <hi>Elders of Ephesus,</hi> and poures out his passionate and affectionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions into their bosome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Where is there any the least shew of the joynt voices</hi> and suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Apostles, Elders, and select Brethren, <hi>of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here were none but the <hi>Elders of Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> things in the text <hi>argue they</hi> were Rulers <hi>of one Congregation:</hi> They are onely Elders of <hi>the Church,</hi> not Churches, vers. 17. He chargeth them to attend <hi>to the flock.</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                           </gap>. v. 28.</p>
                        <p>But had they been the Elders of never <hi>so many Churches,</hi>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:111062:230"/> sent for by the <hi>Holy</hi> Apostle, to take <hi>his farewell of them,</hi> and to leave some spirituall Councell with them: Alack a day, what is this to <hi>a Synod,</hi> or to the <hi>Ecclesiastick Authority of a Synod</hi> over particular Congregations? Here there is neither joynt voices, nor disputing, nor decreeing, but onely hearing and attending the last words of a dying and departing Apostle.</p>
                        <p>To reason thus; If the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> met at <hi>Miletum,</hi> were sent for by <hi>Paul,</hi> to come to visite him, as he passed by in his travell, and to take their farewell of him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some holy councell from him;</p>
                        <p>Then Synods have an Ecclesiasticall Power over Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>How unreasonable would such a reason seeme?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The last place alledged of</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>(The laying on of the hand of the Eldership upon Timothy)</hi> is I confesse accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with much difficulty and obscurity, and deserves through examination; but <hi>this place</hi> hath been <hi>opened</hi> and handled <hi>in the head of Ordination,</hi> whether we refer for the while: we shall only <hi>now</hi> attend so much as concerned the <hi>present Argument.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whatever then is the meaning of the text, its certain, it fals short of that, for which it is alledged here by Master <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford, nor</hi> doth it <hi>prove</hi> the Proposition for which it is brought; nay if his allegation may be attended, it wholly <hi>crosseth a maine Conclusion,</hi> for <hi>the maintenance whereof he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>it proves not</hi> that for which its brought is evident by the letter of the text; for the Proposition under hand to be made good, is this;</p>
                        <p>That the waighty affaires were managed by the voices and suffrages of Apostles, Pastors, and select Brethren of many Congregations.</p>
                        <p>But in the place of <hi>Timothy</hi> we have onely the hand of the Eldership; but not a word of any select Brethren, that were interested in this work.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nay it will appeare upon search, if this Argument be good to prove this cause, for which it is brought, its certain it will <hi>confute another cause strongly maintained by</hi> Master <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford;</hi> for I reason thus:</p>
                        <p>If the laying on the hands upon <hi>Timothy</hi> was, by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111062:230"/> of the Elders and select Brethren of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then Ordination is not an act proper to the Eldership, but issues from the power of the select Brethren also, and so the Church of Beleevers have a hand in it.</p>
                        <p>But the first is true by Master <hi>Rutherfords</hi> assertion; The laying the hand in <hi>Timothy</hi> his Ordination, was by concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Elders and select Brethren of many Congregations.</p>
                        <p>Let Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> now take his choice; If he deny the Assumption, then he doth confesse by that deniall, that the place was wholly misalledged by him, and that he missed his purpose and the proofe of that it was brought for.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>consequence</hi> of the Proposition upon his own grounds cannot be gainesayed; if the select Brethren have a joynt hand and suffrage in the worke of Ordination with the Eldership, then is not the work proper to the Elders, for which he hath so frequently, so constantly contended through his whole booke. We have stayed the longer, because we desired to clear this coast, that when these places come in our way, we may look over them without any trouble, or once making a stand or stumble at them.</p>

                        <p>For <hi>Reply,</hi> I shall by way of prevention, desire to settle that which <hi>is our tenet: That Doctors and Pastors may preach, to all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111062:231"/> sorts, upon all occasions, when opportunity and liberty is offered, nay they ought so to do.</hi> But this they do <hi>not as Pastors, but as gifted and inabled Christians,</hi> who use their talents given them by God and Christ, to the best advantage of Gods glory and the good of others, as any opportunity is presented and put into their hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But they neither do, nor in truth have right to exercise any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and jurisdiction over them,</hi> and this I shall prove in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cases from his <hi>own grant.</hi> For pag. 226. speaking against the opinion and expressions of Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Beast,</hi>
                           <q>That will have Pastors so far strangers to all Congregations, save onely their own, that they say, other Churches are without, and that they have nothing to do to judge them, and alledge for this, <hi>1 Cor. 5.12.</hi> but by those who are without, <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth not those who were not of the congregation of <hi>Corinth</hi> but he meaneth Infidels and heathens, as in other Scriptures: for <hi>Paul</hi> judged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander, 1 Tim. 1.20.</hi> Who were without the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is <hi>granted then</hi> by Master <hi>Rutherford,</hi> that Pagans and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are <hi>without, in the Apostles judgement,</hi> and that the Pastor of <hi>Corinth</hi> could <hi>not judge them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Those whom Pastors of Churches cannot Ecclesiastically judge, over them they have no pastor-like power, nor can be said in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of speech to be Pastors to such.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But Pagans and Infidels, Pastors of Churches cannot judge, therefore over them they have no pastorlike power, nor can in truth be called their Pastors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>own grant</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>proposition</hi> cannot be gainsaied: for the <hi>power of order and jurisdiction,</hi> ever go together. The <hi>being of a Pastor</hi> to a people, doth, in the very nature and constitution of the Call and Office <hi>give power of judgement,</hi> over that people to whom he stands in that relation, as being <hi>one speciall act of feeding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in truth, how comes any man to take a Pastorall power over any Pagans? <hi>By nature</hi> no man hath any: For it is not conveyed by way of Propagation. <hi>By institution</hi> he cannot challenge it; for an extraordinary Commission of that Latitude Christ never gave to any, <hi>but the Apostles, go preach and teach all Nations.</hi> If then any man receives it, it must be by their <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111062:231"/> election and choice,</hi> which because they nor have, nor can shew, they have no right of Ecclesiastick and Office-rule over them; here that question is seasonable, and will not receive an answer, <hi>Who gave you this authority?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nay its certain, a Pastor of one Congregation (elected and setled according to Christ) cannot receive a Pastorall power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pagans, but he must relinquish the place and power in which he is: unlesse we shall bring in an allowance of <hi>pluralities and tot quots,</hi> a conceit so loathsome, that the most ingenious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Papists have abhorred the Patronage of.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, let any man put his power to proof in the exercise of it, and his experience will make it more then plaine, its a thing meerly imagined and arrogated without rule, there is no reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in such presumed rights. For the Pagan offends, he rebukes him, he will not heare; he then takes one or two, he rejects them also: he reports it to the Church, he casts away the advise of any Church. What will the Pastor or his Church do? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him, how will they? how can they? To cast a man out of Church communion, that never was in Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, how irrationall? how impossible? The issue therefore evidenceth, it was a presumption, no power in truth; for when it comes to proofe its powerlesse.</p>
                        <p>Before we leave this place, let me <hi>leave two things upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> with the Reader, which may lead him to a right conceiving of what he hath met withall, or shall meet with touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>power of a Church</hi>-Ruler. For from the premises its plaine.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>bare preaching</hi> to a people, though it was ordinary and often, is <hi>not an act of pastorall power</hi> and so <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> but his Commission is mainly to be attended, which gives vigour and validity in that worke. And therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A man <hi>may preach by Pastorall power,</hi> in some place, <hi>to some people,</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> person may preach <hi>without pastorall jurisdiction</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> but onely <hi>as an</hi> able <hi>gifted</hi> Christian.</p>
                        <q>2. Againe out of Master <hi>Rutherford his grant</hi> in another place, I shall <hi>dispute</hi> against <hi>his opinion</hi> expressed in this. Its a <hi>conclusion</hi> which he sets down, pag. 72.</q>
                        <p>
                           <q>We deny that Christ hath given power, of jurisdiction to one
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111062:232"/> particular congregation over another particular congregations, <hi>pag. 199.</hi> We grant that one Presbytery hath no jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another Presbytery.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Suppose now that one, or many, or all, of one Presbytery, should be destitute of Elders: The Pastors of another Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cannot exercise any pastorlike acts there: nor yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Province and Nation: by the same proportion <hi>over whom they have no jurisdiction, over them they can exercise no pastorlike power; but the first is granted, and therefore the second is yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us now listen to the reasons which Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, <hi>whereby he endeavours to prove; because the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Independent Congregations doth not authorise persons to be Pastors and Teachers to Pagans, and by Pastorall authority, to make them the Churches of Christ, therefore that government is deficient in the meanes of the propagation of the Gospell.</hi>

                           <hi>Reply.</hi> That each Congregation should have their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and teachers, and that out of their calling and commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they have pastorall power, so they should have care of them, over whom they have taken charge, is granted.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>as Christians</hi> in <hi>love to Christ,</hi> his Gospel and the soules of fellow Christians, as far as liberty, opportunity, and ability will reach, they should <hi>occasionally</hi> put forth their care and paines to promote their spirituall good, is confessed.</p>
                        <p>But that one, or many, or all of them, should have Pastorall authority, and out of that ground exercise pastorall <hi>care over all Churches,</hi> as the place alledged would, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. or indeed over many: its <hi>crosse to the institution of our Saviour,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>The Apostles indeed, because their calling was extraordinary their gifts extraordinary, and assistance extraordinary, they had a larger taske, even the whole world, as Christ field to Till: <hi>All Nations.</hi> Every creature reasonable.</p>
                        <p>But Pastors and Teachers, who have but ordinary gifts, they have but, as it were, <hi>an Acre of ground, a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to till and teach: and he that knowes his duty, and doth his duty, will find enough of that,</hi>

                        <q>As if these places, <hi>1 Cor. 10.32. 1 Cor. 9.19, 20, 21. Rom. 1.14, 15.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply</hi> is. If all this were granted, yet that is not proved, which was propounded, and should be concluded: that because they had not pastorlike authority to make Pagans Churches, therefore they are deficient; all that is here said, falls short of that.</p>
                        <p>But the reason is not onely wide of the marke, but wide of the truth. For besides that of <hi>Rom</hi> 1.14. Which is peculiar to the calling of an Apostle, and therefore presseth no particuliar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111062:233"/> at this day, unlesse any man would vainly conceit he hath a commission to preach to all Nations and all conditions of men, the calling and the date of the Apostles commission being now, out this concernes n particular Officer.</p>
                        <p>The rest o the places respect onely a double Christian duty, unto which all men are bound; namely, That we should walk inoffensive towards all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33. and secondly, we should use our liberty to comply with all mens occasions, that as much as in us lies, we may edify all, which each must do that is not a Pastor, and each Pastor should do as a Christian amongst them, over whom he can exercise no Pastorall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to those of another Presbytery, and of a generall Councell.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He would inferre some <hi>seeming absurdities,</hi> which would follow from this kind of Government. As first, <hi>Hence</hi> (he sayes) <q>It must follow, that when the Grecian Church shall be wronged by the Hebrew, that the Pastors may not Synodically meet, and by joynt authority remove offences. <hi>pag. 225.</hi> Act. <hi>6.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I <hi>reply,</hi> There is no colour for such an inference, nor doth it once touch the thing to be proved; For let it be <hi>granted,</hi> that the <hi>Pastors may meet Synodically, and by authority also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move offences;</hi> yet they shall not have power to give Pastorall Authority to men <hi>to make Churches of Pagans:</hi> Nay from his own grant, though they do thus meet, yet he denies they <hi>can give Power over the Churches under other Presbyteries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second inference is of the same stamp; comes not near the mark.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If followeth that all the meetings of the Apostles and Pastors to take care authoritatively for the Churches, as Act. <hi>1.</hi> Act. <hi>4.35.</hi> Act. <hi>6.2, 3, 4.</hi> Act. <hi>11.1.</hi> Act. <hi>21.18.</hi> Act. <hi>20.28.</hi> Act. <hi>8.14.</hi> Act. <hi>14.1, 2, 3.</hi> Act. <hi>15.6.</hi> were all meetings extraordinary and temporary.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I <hi>reply;</hi> Let all be granted for the present, that he would desire; let these meetings be ordinary, and let them care au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively for the Churches in what they did; yet this gives in no evidence, that they can give Pastorall Power and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to men out of the Churches; for we have heard, that the Apostle affirmed it, and he granted it in this sense; that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111062:233"/> no ordinary Pastors can judge those who are without, and those are Infidels by his grant.</p>
                        <p>So that though they have Power to meet, and these meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be ordinary, yet neither of these grounds will evince that they do, or can give Pastorall Jurisdiction to <hi>judge such as be without:</hi> therefore none of these inferences come near the thing to be proved; For if therefore Government by Independent Congregations be insufficient, because <hi>it authoriseth not persons to be Pastors over Pagans, and by pastorall Authority to make them the Churches of Christ; then this Government by Synodicall meeting, will be insufficient;</hi> for we see it labours of the same fault.</p>
                        <p>The third Inference failes in the same manner as the former.</p>
                        <p>Thus are these Inferences altogether impertinent; but the places themselves are misunderstood, as hath at large been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed in the Reply to the former Answer.</p>
                        <p>Since it hath appeared in all the places formerly handled (for these witnesses have been brought to speake, but their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence proves nothing in issue) there is no Synodicall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any Ecclesiasticall Power authoritatively to impose upon particular Churches; onely in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. there is a true Synod truely gathered, and they did that, which the Churches of Christ should do; consociate with one another, and by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall concurrence, lay all their cares and counsels together, to promote the good of Christs Kingdome.</p>
                        <q>Whether the Apostle <hi>had any thing or nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> in their meeting, upon which Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> layes so much waight and conceives so much mistake, let it be considered?</q>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether the acting of the Deacons work, (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.35.) be ordinary for any?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they had their votes, and ruled the action in every Assembly, whether that was ordinary?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether the care of all, and their Commission reaching all, be ordinary and perpetuall?</p>
                        <p>Master <hi>Rutherfords</hi> 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                           <hi>Argument</hi> is taken from the light of sanctified reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>For sanctified reason teacheth, that the stronger Authority of the greater Politick Body of Christ should help the parts of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111062:234"/> the Body, that are weaker, as <hi>1 Cor. 12.23, 26.</hi> The whole Body helpeth the weaker and lesse honourable Member.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is true; but the <hi>Assumption</hi> takes that for granted, which is the very question to be proved, and hath been so often denied: For there be <hi>no Nationall Churches,</hi> which are the <hi>integrum</hi> to particular Congregations <hi>as the parts</hi> thereof: Nor doth the pattern <hi>Act.</hi> 15. give any evidence of <hi>Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction,</hi> as hath been declared before; and if it did, surely there would come very slow help, if we should send 200. <hi>miles to Synods alwayes,</hi> as that place sets a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent before us.</p>
                        <p>As their Members are the greater, they may and should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate, and lay their Counsels together, and in the multitude of Councellers there is safety.</p>

                        <p>I reply; What if the Synod Nationall, OEcumenicall, be corrupt and hereticall, and refuse to do it? There is no more help in the one, then in the other upon supposals.</p>

                     <div type="subsection">
                        <head>Reply.</head>
                        <p>For reply. <hi>The proposition is denyed,</hi> because there is a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous difference</hi> betwixt the <hi>Nationall Church of the Jewes, and all other Churches,</hi> that ever were or shall be since that unto the end of the world. For that was a <hi>Nationall Church truely and properly</hi> so called and so appointed by God, had <hi>Nationall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Offices peculiar</hi> to it selfe, and so also authoritative power, which was appropriate to them in a speciall manner, none of which ever did, nor can belong to any other Nation in the world beside.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nor</hi> yet <hi>doth it follow</hi> from hence, that the Churches of the Gentiles in times of the New Testament, be without these, <hi>that therefore they are left in a worse case,</hi> because they had the Types, we the truth; they the shadow, we the body. <hi>Every Congregation visible, rightly gathered, hath right unto, and use of all Ordinances, all the Officers, both the Seales of the Covenant:</hi> so that we need not go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> either to <hi>Passeover,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any man reason thus. If Christ hath left the Church of a Nation in the New Testament in no worse case then the Church of the Jewes, then he hath left them an High Priest, then he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111062:235"/> hath appointed them to meet three times in the yeere, to the exercise and performance of solemn services and sacrifices. The feeblenesse of the dispute would discover it self at the first view. The same fault is in this reason.</p>
                        <p>But the Jewes had these solemne Assemblies for ends before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Obj. 1. <q>But these were morall and concern us. <hi>2.</hi> Without them these publike ends cannot be attained.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>We shall way the severals shortly in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>granted</hi> then. 1. That the whole Nation of the Jewes was an elected and adopted Nation by God, and the whole Land taken into Covenant with him.</p>
                        <p>And hence its granted also, that in cases of Apostasies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures from God and his worship, the godly Kings might and did recall this backsliding people to recover and renew the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant formerly made by God with them: and therefore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. <hi>Their Elders, Officers, all the men of Israel, their little ones, wives, and the stranger within their gates, they all stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi> (Here is more then Elders and select Brethren, sent as Commissioners to a Nationall Synod) Here's <hi>Captaines, Hewers of wood,</hi> all the men of Israel, women, children, which evidenceth it was <hi>a Nationall covenant,</hi> into which God entred with them. And therefore the godly Kings, they might recall them back to this, when just occasion did require.</p>
                        <p>But no King nor Emperour did the <hi>like to this,</hi> in <hi>calling their Synods:</hi> nor indeed have they, either <hi>morall Law,</hi> or <hi>ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law,</hi> nor in truth <hi>any Law</hi> to deale with a Nation on this manner, to call them to renew <hi>a Nationall Church covenant,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Jewes.</p>
                        <p>Gods people, who enter into Church covenant and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the faith, are and should be free in so doing. Church fellowship is to be ordered and acted by Ecclesiasticall policy, not civil. If a Prince on earth should by covenant and Oath; make his whole Kingdome a Nationall Church, he should doe more then he hath any word of Christ to warrant his worke.</p>
                        <p>So that it is one thing for Emperours or Kings to call coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Elders and select Brethren: Another thing for the King of Israel to call all Israel together, men, women, and children to renew Church covenant which God had made with them, and with no other people on earth.</p>

                        <p>But let us attend <hi>Mr.</hi> Rutherfords <hi>proofe of</hi> this, that these Assemblies <hi>were morall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>An Oath to keep Gods Commandements, is a part of the third Commandement, <hi>Psal. 119.106.</hi> We are injoyned to contend for the Faith, <hi>Jude 3.</hi> and to professe God before men, and that which binds one man morally, binds a Nation.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I reply.</hi> The reason is weak, and the ground of it is worse.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is weak</hi> put it but into <hi>forme,</hi> and it will discover it's own feeblenesse at the first appearance.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>David</hi> swore that he would keep Gods righteous Statutes, then its lawfull to sweare to a Nationall Church, as that of the Jewes was.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>consequence</hi> is unsound, because <hi>Davids</hi> taking an Oath was upon lawfull grounds, to do a lawfull thing: but to do the second, is now unlawfull, because all such Nationall Churches, and such a manner of covenanting, as they did, is now abrogated and antiquated.</p>
                        <p>Beside were the thing lawfull, yet the taking of the Oath might be unwarrantable in the one, and not in the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Oaths and promises, that is one speciall ingredient to make them warrantable, that they suit with our strength: and hence that which is usefull and helpfull to one, because strong and able to go through the performance of his Oath, to another it is hurtful because not sufficient to accomplish what he swears. The same answer will satisfie that of <hi>Jude,</hi> and the 10 of <hi>Math.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the reason is weake, <hi>so the ground is worse;</hi> For its said, what binds one man morally, binds a Nation; which rule applied to the former practice of <hi>Davids</hi> Oath, failes many wayes.</p>
                        <p>For 1. Though when a man hath sworne, he is bound by a morall Command to keep his Oath, and so his promise; yet this <hi>manner of swearing,</hi> seeming to be <hi>private,</hi> its but a <hi>free-will offering,</hi> as the Nature of vowing or promising is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I vow, I may; and if I will not, I may choose: And I do beleeve a man may live all his life, and never take a <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Oath;</hi> I say private <hi>betwixt God and himselfe,</hi> to keep his Lawes, and yet <hi>not be guilty of sinne</hi> in so doing: so that a man is not morally and necessarily tied to swear or vow, though having vowed, he is necessarily bound to performe it: If thou dost not vow, thou dost not sinne.</p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:111062:236"/>
                        <p>But 2. Be it granted, that it is morall, yet the rule seemes exceeding uneven. <hi>That which bindes one man morally bindes a whole Nation,</hi> take it generally, as here propounded in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, when as there be some speciall duties, that in a peculiar manner belong to his particular, which a Nation need not do, nay should not, nay cannot do.</p>
                        <p>A man finds by constant proof that drinking of wine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prejudiciall to his health, and hurtfull also to his soul, being <hi>given,</hi> as the Wise-man sayes, <hi>to his appetite,</hi> and so apt to sinne: He finds it possible for him to abstaine; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sweares he will drink no wine in such Company for such a space.</p>
                        <p>Another hath found himselfe somewhat too abstemious, and hath prejudiced his health out of neglect of the lawfull use of the Creature; He sweares he will use such meanes provided for his health: These men are morally bound, both to take the Oath and keepe their Oath: <hi>Do these Oathes bind the whole Nation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Schollar swears he will study conscionably: The Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that he will plow so painefully; These are morall bonds to those men, but <hi>is a whole Nation bound thus to swear?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The truth is, the contrary rule for the most part is most true; that which morally binds one man in things speciall appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his morall course, doth not bind a whole Nation.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, The ends of generall Reformation may be attained by Power of the Civill Magistrate, who may authoritatively require all the Churches in all their severall Assemblies, to attend the mind of Christ, and solemnly humble themselves by fasting and prayer, and see Reformation wrought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God, in their severall places; and if they see Churches be holy, they will willingly listen thereunto; and if corrupt, they may be compelled by the Civill Power to attend the rules of Christ, which through the corruption that is now crept in amongst them, they would be content to cast off.</p>

                  <p>Three things are maine.</p>

                  <p>Thus we find one Church sends to another; or to many, as the weight of the businesse may require, so in <hi>Coloss. Philippi, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sense is somewhat too large for our present considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it appeares by stating of the question by all, who on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose have set themselves to search into the nature of Synods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a meeting</hi> by way of <hi>combination,</hi> when Churches, <hi>cousociating</hi> together by mutuall consent, enter upon <hi>a common ingagement to administer help</hi> each to other, as any apparant oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111062:238"/> shall appeare to call for consultation for a common good.</p>
                  <p>And in this sense it is here taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesiasticall,]</hi> its so termed, not only because of the persons who are there assembled, nor yet because of the occasion, there to be agitated, which may be meerly and only Ecclesiasticall, at least Ecclesiastically handled, but especially (for now we speak according to the opinions and apprehensions of those, with whom the question is controverted) because such meetings are peculiar to Churches, and the actings are appropriated thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as any other Church administrations, and if we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their opinion by their practise, it cannot be otherwise.</p>
                  <p>For they, who allow Synods to censure by way of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication (which is a judicature only appertaining to the Church) they must needs make the constitution properly Ecclesiasticall. For the <hi>Operation</hi> discovers, and certainly determines what the <hi>Constitution</hi> must be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The parties who constitute</hi> this meeting must be,
<list>
                        <item>1. Fitting men, able for the worke, and that gives the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale to the messenger.</item>
                        <item>2. Chosen and sent by the Church, and that is the <hi>formalis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> of a member of the Assembly.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And all the Presbyterians, I meet withall, do constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and approve.</p>
                  <p>Hence upon these grounds and the true stating of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to their intent;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Magistrate <hi>qua talis,</hi> is no member, nor can act in this meeting, as such.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is no act of an Office or Officer, because the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> to make one a member, is the choosing and sending; and therefore, they who are no Officers, if so elected and appointed, they have <hi>jus suffragii.</hi> They who are Officers, if yet not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor sent, they have no <hi>jus suffragii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence, all have equall power, because equally sent and chosen, which are the substantiall ingredients to make up Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall members.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Any member, though not an Officer, if he be elected as moderator of the Synod, may as legally and regularly and as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111062:238"/> sufficiently supply that place, as any who is an Officer.</p>
                  <p>As suppose some learned Reader in a Vniversity chosen to the Synod, though he be no Pastor, he may be elected to that place, and act in it regularly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence, none have this power, unlesse they be sent, because that gives the formale to this action.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hence, these cannot censure by way of excommuunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to Presbyterian principles; because none by their rules can censure so, but Officers; But here none act as Officers, <hi>id est,</hi> though they be Officers in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, yet they act not so here, but <hi>as called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence this Power is not intrinsecall to their Office, but wholly superadded; and if Authors, who call it <hi>Potestatem accumulativam, non privativam,</hi> intend this sense, they say true, namely, it is a speciall Power, beside an officiall Power.</p>
                  <p>But if that be their meaning, That it is an Office-power only with additament, its a totall mistake; For many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have not this Power, and many not Officers, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, have it.</p>
                  <q>The third thing in the Description, is the end, which is to discover and determine of doubtfull questions, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinion and Practice.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>They are to debate and set downe their judgements clearly and definitively, not to leave the Churches, whence they are sent, in doubts and demurrs; For that was to misse the end of their sending and meeting: But they dogmatise their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and set down their determinations, as sure truths to their judgements and apprehensions, and so returne them to the particular Churches whence they came; and their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations take place, not because they concluded so, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Churches approved of what they have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                  <p>For the Churches sent them, and therefore are above them: And therefore may send other if they see fit, who may vary in their judgements, and alter their sentences if they see fit.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Potestas Authoritativa</hi> or <hi>Juridica,</hi> whereby they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute censures, and impose their sentences to be received and subjected unto under that penalty.</p>
                  <p>And this Power is not so seated in any Church, as that it can chaleng it of it selfe: For by all Presbyterian principles it is confessed, That one Congregation hath no Power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one Classis over another, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence this Power issues from their Combination of one with another, and subjection of one to another.</p>
                  <p>But whether they should give this Power unto any, or thus be subject unto any, &amp;c. when the Authority of Synods comes to be scanned, we shall speak to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, The Power of Synods is by others conceived to be onely consultative, when Churches by way of Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their mutuall support in truth and peace, do with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent appoint times of meeting for their mutuall help, that they may lend common relief by their Common Counsell, and have the benefit of each others gifts &amp; abilities; or though they be not in any set consociation, if there be any emergent occasions of more danger or difficulty, they send for help of Counsell, to such as are most able to lend and administer it, though furthest removed from their society and fellowship: As the practice of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> is most pregnant to this purpose.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ANSW. That there should be Synods, which have <hi>Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111062:239"/> juridicam,</hi> is no where proved in Scripture, because it is not a truth: such a Power will appear after to be unlawfull, and therefore never appointed by God, nor approved by his Word.</p>
                  <p>The Examples given out of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. carry no full and satisfying evidence with them.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. is deficient many wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they had Power juridicall, it must arise by way of Combination; But that they were not in, being 200 miles distant at the least one from another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that was a Synod, it must be referred to some of the species of a Synod.</p>
                  <p>But it can be referred to none of the species; Its neither Classis, Provinciall, nor Nationall Synod, as the distance from Jerusalem gives in evidence.</p>
                  <p>And an OEcumenicall Councell it was not, because that is gathered out of all Nations; here were but two Churches.</p>
                  <p>OBj. If it be here said, because the Apostles were here present, who had Power over all Churches; therefore it may in that regard be called a Generall or OEcumenicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. It is easy to reply, That there can be no just war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant taken from thence for such an Assertion: For if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did act here as particular persons, not by any Apostolicall Power, then their presence, look at them as private persons, cannot make a Generall Councell.</p>
                  <p>But their acting in this Synod was not as Apostles by way of revelation or peculiar assistance; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That cannot make a Generall Councell.</p>
                  <p>They disputed as others, consented, concluded, subscribed, and sent as others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. One Church hath no power over another:</p>
                  <p>But here is but one Church advising with another, <hi>Antioch</hi> with <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The minor is in the text; the Proposition is a confessed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and reason gives force of confirmation; For it carries some appearance with it, that one should yie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:111062:240"/>4. All juridicall Power issues from Combination.</p>
                  <p>Therefore those onely are bound, that are so combined and sent.</p>
                  <p>But this Synod sent their <hi>dogmata</hi> and sentences to the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who never sent any Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thither, and <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that they intended and acted was by a way of Councell.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The controversy arising from the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> they repairing for judgement, cannot be judges in their own cause, now controverted by an opposite party.</p>
                  <p>Hence there was but one Church that gave in the sentence, and that cannot make a Synod.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Each Practice or Example is so far warrantable and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it hath either some particular precept to injoyne it, or some generall rule that may confirme it by way of colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>But here is no particular precept to injoyn it; let them shew any generall rule appropriate to Church discipline or Church government to bottome it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr Whitaker</hi> confesseth, there is no precept for Synods.</p>
                  <p>The reason alledged for proof, hath no convicting evidence in it.</p>
                  <p>For when it is said,</p>
                  <p>An ordinary Assembly of Church-members, Elders and Brethren of many Churches meeting by occasion of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, to dispute and cleare truth from Scripture, is founded on <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>But this is a Synod.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. To the major, Such an Assembly met of many Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of many Churches, is not found, nor can be proved out of the <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They met not to dispute and determine <hi>juridic√®.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same fault is in that proof of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> went up to the Apostles to gain mutuall consent and approbation, not to submit his office or doctrine <hi>juridic√®</hi> to them at all, for this he professedly gainsayes, that he had not his office from man, or by man; and that his doctrine was from God by revelation, as well as theirs.</p>
                  <p>If he come to advantage his proceeding by mutuall consent and approbation, then other Churches may meet together by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111062:240"/> way of jurisdiction; there is no soundnesse in such a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                  <p>The reasons also reach not this Power.</p>
                  <p>For errors may be prevented, truth cleared, union of Churches in judgment preserved, and they kept from running in vain, and all neighbouring Churches may be consulted with in more waighty transactions, without this meeting in this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiciall manner.</p>
                  <p>But if Synods and such meetings be attended onely in way of consultation, as having no other power, nor meeting for any other end:</p>
                  <p>Then as they are lawfull, so the root of them lyes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principle which God in providence hath appointed for humane proceeding, and that is,</p>
                  <p>He that hearkens to counsell shall be safe.</p>
                  <p>In the multitude of Councellers there is safety.</p>
                  <p>Hence all conditions and callings, as they need, so they use a Combination of counsell, for the carrying on of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions under their hand.</p>
                  <p>Hence arise the Companies of Merchants, and all men of all Crafts.</p>
                  <p>Hence Common Councels in all Kingdomes and States.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the Course of Christianity also the Churches of Christ should use the meanes which God hath appointed for their more comfortable and succesfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a Church-way.</p>
                  <p>And hence one Church may send to another, or to many, and that severally or joyntly meeting.</p>
                  <p>Hence send to the most able: As <hi>Antioch</hi> sent to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> because though it was farre remote, yet in reason they might expect more reliefe, because of the joynt being of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles together.</p>
                  <p>Beside, they were concerned in some manner therein, as it appeares, some came as from them, and pretended the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apostles touching the necessity of Circumcision, to whom say the Apostles, we gave no such allowance.</p>
                  <p>OBj. If it be said, this course of Councell is common to all sorts, and therefore they may as well consult with any, as with Churches.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. True, they may, and in some cases should consult with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111062:241"/> the Chief learned men and Readers of Divinity in severall U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities, or such who have the chiefest skill in the occasions which are in doubt.</p>
                  <p>But because the occasion of one Church may deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne others. 2. Because Churches are in reason most fit and best able, and will be most affected with the conditions of other Churches, Therefore its most suitable to right reason, and the rules of consultation to advise with such.</p>

                  <p>All censures are administred by men in office.</p>
                  <p>But here the actions issue not from such.</p>
                  <p>Those acts which proceed in common from men without, as well as in office, those cannot be acts of men in office.</p>
                  <p>But all acts of the Synod are performed by all the Members of the Synod.</p>
                  <p>It seemes good to the Spirit and unto us, that was, all the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111062:241"/> Brethren, as well, as the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They grant, that all the Power the Synod hath, is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative, not privative; it takes nothing from the Power of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>But thus to censure, would take Power from the Churches.</p>
                  <p>That which crosseth the Power given by Christ, that dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth their lawfull and rightfull Power.</p>
                  <p>But this doth so; For Christ saith, <hi>He that will not hear the Church, let him be as a heathen:</hi> But this Power gives them leave to refuse the admonition of the Church, and to appeal, and so nullifies the proceeding of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which gives power over a Church without the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the judgement of the Rulers, nay happely, against their judgement, that diminisheth the power of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But this doth so: As in case all the Elders of a particular Congregation shall gainsay the censure, and the rest of the Synod passe a censure against the Elders.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Excommunication is proper to the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they take that which is their propriety.</p>
                  <p>That it is proper, it thus appears.</p>
                  <p>Its either proper to the Congregation, or else common to both.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it fals firstly and properly somewhere else, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, it belongs to the Church in generall first, and then to both the species.</p>
                  <p>But this cannot be.</p>
                  <p>That which is firstly in the genus, doth belong indifferently to both species from thence.</p>
                  <p>But all the power the Classis hath, they have it from the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it was firstly there, not in a Church in the generall, as belonging to Synods and to Congregations.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:111062:242"/>1. A Synod, in this question, is usually restrained to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councell, or an Oecumenick Synod, as it may appeare in Doctor <hi>Whitaker.</hi> For as touching Provinciall or Nationall councels, he grants they were commonly convocated by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Metropolitan, or Patriach, who had an inspection into such places, by humane appointment</p>
                  <p>Though I confesse, in a safe and faire sense, I would extend it further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Convocare.</hi> The greatest waight lyes in the explication of this word, <hi>what it is to call,</hi> and if we may looke at it, in the full bounds and limits, as its often considered by such as inquire into all the ingredients of this action,</p>
                  <p>Then it implyes two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of appointment and injunction to require the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and publike concurrence and assembly of some persons of severall Churches, for such ends, as hath above been specified.</p>
                  <p>I say a publike and solemn Assembly and concurrence of Churches.</p>
                  <p>For, if it be but private and clandestine by some privy inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation one from another, to meet in a secret manner, as under the colour, and by the rule of Christian society, We look not at such meeting as Synodicall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This publike concurrence, it must be appointed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, not attained by way of intreaty;</p>
                  <p>As persons dissenting, and being in difference one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are said, in one usuall phrase, to call in Arbitrators, or by intreaty to desire the help of such persons, to consider and end their controversie.</p>
                  <p>Such a kind of calling which is by occasionall intreaty, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the stresse and state of this question.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I find some also, who make this as one branch, which growes to the body of this question.</p>
                  <q>Whether they who call, may name and specify the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons who must be sent, or may refuse such as be sent, in case they seeme to their judgement, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which appeare just to them, that they are unfit.</q>
                  <p>And here mens apprehensions vary.</p>
                  <p>Some will allow the Magistrate to injoyne and require the Churches to send: But the Churches must make choice of those whom they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>end.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:111062:243"/>
                  <p>Others conceive it is in the Magistrates hand to appoint both.</p>
                  <p>Againe,</p>
                  <p>This power of appointing they look at it in a double consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>Either as a Commission, which they give, whereby they are inabled unto this action.</p>
                  <p>Or onely a permission, that the Churches having power of themselves, the Magistrate suffers them, or will not hinder them from putting it forth.</p>
                  <p>And the issue then returns to this,</p>
                  <p>It belongs to the supreme Magistrate, and the power of his place, to injoyn the solemn and publike concurrence of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall persons of the Churches, and to appoint and nominate whom of those he will have to consider of such weighty and doubtfull cases, which concerne the publike profession and practising of the worship of God, within his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>When I say, It belongs to his power and place, I meane to him it is peculiar, and doth not belong to the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I say, The publike and solemn concurrence is appointed by him.</p>
                  <p>They may, as Christians, maintaine private communion, one with another, seeke, and by intreaty call for the councell and helpe one of another, and as they be Churches, use that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an priviledge of <hi>auxilium &amp; consilium,</hi> to further their own good, and promote the worke under their hand: And that act requires no allowance of Magistrate at all.</p>
                  <p>For what I do, <hi>qu√† Ethicus, qu√† Oeconomicus,</hi> and so <hi>qu√† Christianus</hi> in private, it appertaines not to him to inquire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided It intrench not upon his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But when any proceed to publike and solemn Assemblings, this comes properly under the Cognizance of the Magistrate, as falling professedly in his way, and requires his <hi>allowance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say allowance; for in such acts, which issue from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abilities or dexterities of men <hi>Commissio &amp; justa permissio</hi> are all one, at least make no great difference.</p>
                  <p>The Magistrate allowes a scholler, a fencer, to set up Schools of their Art, there needs no more Commission, but such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to such actions in a state.</p>
                  <q>Before I descend to the Arguments, there be two <hi>postulata</hi> I shall premise.</q>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:111062:243"/>1. That a right opinion and worship of God should be openly professed within the territories and jurisdiction of a State, appertaines to them, as that which comes within the verg and object of the state and policy to attend.</p>
                  <p>For how could they provide for their subjects, to live in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and honesty without this?</p>
                  <p>How should they be nursing Fathers and Mothers to the Church and Religion, if they should suffer open Blasphemy and Idolatry to be maintained and professed?</p>
                  <p>Nay in that such crimes were punished with death in Israel, its plaine, the Kings did it, not as Types of Christ, but by a civil power.</p>
                  <p>For no spirituall power useth the weapons of this world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence the supream Magistrate hath liberty and power both to inquire and judge of professions and Religions, which is true, and ought to be maintained, which is false, and ought to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>For were he bound to follow the judgement of the Churches, or Ministers, if they should judge a Toleration of all Religions lawfull, or judge the false to be true, he then were bound to nurse the false Religion, and false Churches.</p>
                  <q>Now we shall proceed to the Reasons for the setling of the truth, which was the second thing to be attended.</q>

                     <p>If it be in the Magistrates power lawfully to forbid and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then it is not in the power of the Churches lawfully to do.</p>
                     <p>For then the same thing should, in the same regard be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unlawfull: an the rules of providence should be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite one to another.</p>
                     <p>But the supreme Magistrate may lawfully hinder any people of another Kingdome to come into his: or his own subjects to go out of his territories without his leave.</p>
                     <p>Otherwise, he should want lawfull power to oppose such, as would come in to undermine or lay wast the State, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111062:244"/> the going out of his own subjects to other Nations, there will be no generall concurrence, nor councel.</p>
                     <p>And the same power he hath to confine his own people from such generall Assemblings, within his own precincts. For there may be the like just reasons.</p>

                     <p>The first Proposition is evident from the diversity of the Rules, by which actions are put forth.</p>
                     <p>A civill act belongs not to an Ecclesiastick power, because that which they do, is only done by the Ecclesiasticall policy.</p>
